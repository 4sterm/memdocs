# Copilot in Intune FAQ

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is being updated for Copilot.

## FAQ

### open prompting

### Does Copilot give my admins more access to Intune data than what they have using the Intune admin center?

No. The Intune features are built on top of existing Microsoft Graph API's â€“ the same API's that the Intune admin center uses. Copilot honors existing Intune permissions and scope tags when getting data.

### Is there any way to limit which Intune admins see the Copilot experience?

No. All users of the Intune admin center can see the Copilot features.

### Can I use other Microsoft Copilot for Security capabilities from other services, like Defender, Microsoft Entra and Purview from within the Intune admin center?

No. The Copilot in Intune is limited to only Intune capabilities. You can use the full Microsoft Copilot for Security to get insights from other Microsoft services.

### Copilot appears to show the wrong info. How can I debug and validate this?

If you think that the output is incorrect, you can:

- Use the F12 developer tools in Microsoft Edge to debug the issue. In the developer debug tool, select the **Network** view. In Copilot, select the prompt to get the output. In the developer debug tool, use the **logs** entries to look more closely at the steps between the prompt input and output.

- If you're using Copilot to get more information about a specific device, then please provide feedback and add details about what you're seeing. There's a **Feedback** button in the Copilot prompt:

- If you're working with Microsoft to debug the issue, then they may ask you to enable F12 developer tools in your browser. This information shows the capability that Copilot uses.
