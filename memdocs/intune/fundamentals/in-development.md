# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information in this article:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## App management

### iOS Company Portal minimum required version<!-- 13016075 -->
With an upcoming release of the MS Authenticator app, users will be required to update to v5.2204 of the iOS Company Portal. If you have enabled the **[Block installing apps using App Store](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md#settings-apply-to-automated-device-enrollment-supervised)** device restriction setting, you will likely need to push an update to the related devices that use this setting. Otherwise, no action is needed. If you have a helpdesk, you may want to make them aware of the prompt to update the Company Portal app. In most cases, users have app updates set to automatic, so they receive the updated Company Portal app without taking any action. Users that have an earlier app version will be prompted to update to the latest Company Portal app.

### Password complexity for Android devices<!-- 9321870 -->
The **Require device lock** setting in Intune will be extended to include values (**Low Complexity**, **Medium Complexity**, and **High Complexity**). If the device lock doesn't meet the minimum password requirement, you'll be able to **warn**, **wipe data**, or **block** the end user from accessing a managed account in a managed app. 

This feature targets devices that operate on Android 11+. For devices that operate on Android 10 and earlier, setting a complexity value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** will default to the expected behavior for **Low Complexity**. For related information, see [Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune](..\apps\app-protection-policy-settings-android.md).

### Improvements to Win32 App Log collection<!-- 9978316 -->
Win32 App Log collection via Intune Management Extension has moved to the Windows 10 device diagnostic platform, reducing time to collect logs from 1-2 hours to 20 minutes.  We've also increased the size from 60mb to 250mb.  Along with performance improvements, the app logs will also be available under the **Device diagnostics monitor** action for each device, as well as the managed app monitor. For information about how to collect diagnostics, see [Collect diagnostics from a Windows device](..\remote-actions\collect-diagnostics.md) and [Troubleshooting Win32 app installations with Intune](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-win32-app-install).

### Uninstall DMG-type applications on managed macOS devices (Public preview)<!-- 13155022 -->
You will be able to use the Uninstall assignment type to remove DMG-type applications on managed macOS devices from Microsoft Endpoint Manager. You can find macOS DMG apps in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **macOS** > **macOS app (.DMG)**. For related information, [Add a macOS DMG app to Microsoft Intune](../apps/lob-apps-macos-dmg.md).

## Device configuration

### Use the Settings Catalog to create a Universal Print policy on Windows 11 devices<!-- 5513123 -->
Many organizations are moving their printer infrastructure to the cloud. [Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-whatis) is a cloud-based printing solution for Microsoft 365 customers. It uses built-in cloud printers, built-in legacy printers, and runs entirely in Microsoft Azure. When Universal Print is deployed with Universal Print-compatible printers, it doesn't require any on-premises infrastructure. 

In the Endpoint Manager admin center, you'll be able to use the Settings Catalog to create a printer policy (**Device configuration** > **Create profile** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type > **Printer provisioning**). When you deploy the policy, users select the printer from a list of registered Universal Print printers, and can also select a default printer.

Currently, you must use the [Universal Print printer provisioning tool](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-intune-tool), which requires more manual steps, and has some limitations.

Applies to:
- Windows 11
