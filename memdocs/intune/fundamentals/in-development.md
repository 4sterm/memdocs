## App management

### Changes to app backup and restore behavior on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices<!-- 16261392  -->  
As an app setting, you can select to **Prevent iCloud app backup** for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices. You will have the option to *not* back up managed App Store apps and line-of-business (LOB) apps on iOS/iPadOS, as well as managed App Store apps on macOS devices (macOS LOB apps won’t support this feature), for both user and device licensed VPP/non-VPP apps. This will include both new and existing App Store/LOB apps sent with and without VPP that are being added to Intune and targeted to users and devices.

Preventing the backup of the specified managed apps will ensure that these apps can be properly deployed via Intune when the device is enrolled and restored from backup. If the admin configures the new setting for new or existing apps in their tenant, managed apps can and will be re-installed for devices, but Intune will no longer allow them to be backed up.

The new setting will appear in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by modifying the properties of an app. For an existing app, you can select **Apps** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** > *select the app* > **Properties** > Assignment **Edit**. If no group assignment has been set, click **Add group** to add a group. Modify either the setting under **VPN**, **Uninstall on device removal**, or **Install as removable**. Then, select **Prevent iCloud app backup**. The **Prevent iCloud app backup** setting is used to prevent backup of app data for the application. Set to **No** to allow the app to be backed up by iCloud.

For more information, see [Changes to applications’ backup and restore behavior on iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/changes-to-applications-backup-and-restore-behavior-on-ios/ba-p/3692064).

### Prevent automatic updates for Apple VPP apps<!-- 16876430   -->  
You'll soon be able to control the automatic update behavior for Apple VPP at the per-app assignment level using the new **Prevent automatic updates** setting. This setting will be available in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** > *Select a volume purchase program app* > **Properties** > **Assignments** > *Select an AAD group* > **App settings**.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

### Install required apps during pre-provisioning<!-- 12716381   -->  
A new toggle will be available in the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) profile that allows you to select whether you want to attempt to install required applications during pre-provisioning (white glove) technician phase. We understand that installing as many applications as possible during pre-provisioning is desired to reduce the end user set up time. To help you achieve this, we have implemented an option to attempt the installation of all the required apps assigned to a device during technician phase. In case of app install failure, ESP will continue except for the apps specified in ESP profile. To enable this function, you will need to edit your Enrollment Status Page profile by selecting **Yes** on the new setting entitled **Only fail selected apps in technician phase**. This setting will only appear if you have blocking apps selected. For information about ESP, go to [Set up the Enrollment Status Page](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md).

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users won't be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal<!-- 5145748 -->  
*The time frame for the release of this update is still being determined.*

Users will be able to uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal. If a Win32 app can be uninstalled by the user, the user will be able to select **Uninstall** for the Win32 app in the Company Portal. For more information about Win32 apps, go to [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Global quiet time app policy settings<!-- 15424417 -->  
The global quiet time settings will allow you to create policies to schedule quiet time for your end users, which will automatically mute Microsoft Outlook email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms. These policies can be used to limit end user notifications received after work hours. When this feature is available, you will be able to find it in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **Quiet Time** > **Policies**.

## Device configuration

### Updates to the macOS Settings Catalog <!-- 17673709  -->  
The [Settings Catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md) lists all the settings you can configure in a device policy, and all in one place.

A new setting is available in the Settings Catalog. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), you can see these settings at **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Settings catalog** for profile type.

The new setting is located under:

**Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) > [targeted app]**:

- Update channel override

The following settings have been deprecated:

**Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) > [targeted app]**:

- Channel Name (Deprecated)

**Privacy > Privacy Preferences Policy Control > Services > Listen Event or Screen Capture**:

- Allowed

Applies to:

- macOS

For more information about configuring Settings Catalog profiles in Intune, go to [Create a policy using settings catalog](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

### New Google domain allow-list settings for Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 14711684  -->  
On Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile, you can configure settings that restrict device features and settings.

Currently, there is an **Add and remove accounts** setting that allows Google accounts be added to the work profile. For this setting, when you select **Allow all accounts types**, you can also configure:

- **Google domain allow-list**: Restricts users to add only certain Google account domains in the work profile. You can import a list of allowed domains or add them in the admin center using the `contoso.com` format. When left blank, by default, the OS might allow adding all Google domains in the work profile.

For more information on the settings you can configure, go to [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

### Disable Activation Lock device action for supervised macOS devices<!-- 16813146  -->  

You'll soon be able to use the **Disable Activation Lock** device action in Intune to bypass Activation Lock on Mac devices without requiring the current username or password. This new action will be available in **Devices** > **macOS** > select one of your listed devices > **Disable Activation Lock**.

More information on managing Activation Lock is available at [Bypass iOS/iPadOS Activation Lock with Intune](../remote-actions/device-activation-lock-disable.md) or on Apple's website at [Activation Lock for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365).

Applies to:

- macOS 10.15 or later


### Support for multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS device inventory<!--17016690 (replaced 16360290 for tracking -->

You'll soon be able to view the service subscription fields on devices that have multiple SIM cards installed under the per-device Hardware section. The inventory fields that are capable of reporting multiple values to Intune are:

- **ICCID**
- **IMEI**
- **MEID**
- **Phone number**

These fields will default to using labels returned by the device, such as:  *Primary*, *Secondary*, *CTSubscriptionSlotOne*, and *CTSubscriptionSlotTwo*. These returned labels may be displayed in the language of the local device that is reporting its inventory to Intune.

Applies to:  
- **iOS/iPadOS**

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device management

### Manage Windows LAPS with Intune polices (public preview)<!-- 11890571  -->  
As a public preview, you’ll soon be able to configure devices for Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS). Configuration of Windows LAPS will be supported through Intune’s [Account protection policy](../protect/endpoint-security-account-protection-policy.md).

In addition, you'll be able to use [Device Actions](../remote-actions/device-management.md) for devices with Windows LAPS policy for the following tasks:

- Rotate local admin password
- Retrieve local admin password

[Windows LAPS](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) is a Windows feature that automatically manages and backs up the password of a local administrator account on your Azure Active Directory-joined or Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices. You also can use Windows LAPS to automatically manage and back up the Directory Services Repair Mode (DSRM) account password on your Windows Server Active Directory domain.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

### New settings available for macOS software update policies<!-- 16646756  -->  
You will soon be able to configure the *Max User Deferrals* and *Priority* settings as part of your macOS software update policies.

- Max User Deferrals:  When an update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify the maximum number of times a user can postpone a minor OS update before it’s installed. The system prompts the user once a day. Available for devices running macOS 12 and later.

- Priority: When an update type is configured to *Install later*, this setting allows you to specify values of *Low* or *High* for the scheduling priority for downloading and preparing minor OS updates. Available for devices running macOS 12.3 and later.

Applies to:
- macOS

### On-demand proactive remediation for a Windows device<!-- 14783338  -->  
A new device action that is in public preview allows you to run a proactive remediation on-demand to a single Windows device. The **Run** remediation device action will allow you to resolve issues without having to wait for a proactive remediation to run on its assigned schedule. You will also be able to view the status of proactive remediations under **Remediations** in the **Monitor** section of a device.

### Endpoint security firewall rules support for ICMP type<!-- 5653356 -->  
We’re adding a new setting named **IcmpTypesAndCodes** to the endpoint security firewall rules template for Windows 10. To configure this in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create Policy** > Platform: *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server*  > Profile: *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules*).

With this new setting, you’ll be able to configure inbound and outbound rules for [Internet Control Message Protocol](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-an-inbound-icmp-rule) (ICMP) as part of a firewall rule.

Applies to:  
- Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Device security

### Support for WDAC Application ID tagging with Intune Firewall Rules policy<!-- 17224780  -->  
Intune's *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules* profiles, which are available as part of endpoint security Firewall policy, will soon support Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Application ID tags. With this capability, you’ll be able to scope your firewall rules to an application or a group of applications and rely on your WDAC policies to define those applications. By using tags to link to and rely on WDAC policies, your Firewall Rules policy won’t need to rely on the firewall rules option of an absolute file path or use of a variable file path that can reduce security of the rule.

Use of this capability requires you to have WDAC policies in place that include *AppId* tags that you can then specify in your Intune Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules.

For more information, see:
- [WDAC Application ID (AppId) Tagging guide](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/appidtagging/windows-defender-application-control-appid-tagging-guide) in the Windows defender application control documentation.
- [Firewall policy for endpoint security in Intune](../protect/endpoint-security-firewall-policy.md)

Applies to:
- Windows 10/11
