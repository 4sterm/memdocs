## App management

### Added protection for iOS/iPadOS app widgets<!-- 14614429 -->

To protect organizational data for MAM managed accounts and apps, Intune app protection policies now provide the capability to block data sync from policy managed app data to app widgets. App widgets can be added to end-user's iOS/iPadOS device lock screen, which can expose data contained by these widgets, such as meeting titles, top sites, and recent notes. In Intune, you'll be able to set the app protection policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with app widgets** to **Block** for iOS/iPadOS apps. This setting will be available as part of the **Data Protection** settings in app protection policies. This new setting will be an app protection feature similar to the **Sync policy managed app data with native app or add-ins** setting.

### Intune migrating from SafetyNet Attestation API to Google Play Integrity API<!-- 15571389   -->

Google has deprecated the [SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation) and replaced it with the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity). Intune will be migrating to the new API for app protection policies. The "SafetyNet device attestation" setting name will be updated to align with the new Google Play Integrity API for all policies in the Intune user interface (UI). For related information, see [Discontinuing the SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/deprecation-timeline) and [Migrating from the SafetyNet Attestation API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/migrate).

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->

Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users won't be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Support for multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS device inventory<!-- 17016690  -->

You'll be able to view the service subscription fields on devices that have multiple SIM cards installed under the per-device Hardware section. The inventory fields that are capable of reporting multiple values to Intune are:

- **ICCID**
- **IMEI**
- **MEID**
- **Phone number**

These fields will default to using labels returned by the device, such as:  *Primary*, *Secondary*, *CTSubscriptionSlotOne*, and *CTSubscriptionSlotTwo*. These returned labels may be displayed in the language of the local device that is reporting its inventory to Intune.

Applies to:

- **iOS/iPadOS**

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device configuration

### The macOS Company Portal app will support platform SSO (public preview)<!-- 24325427  -->

In Intune, you can configure the Enterprise SSO plug-in on Apple devices using a device configuration profile (**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **macOS** for platform > **Settings Catalog** for profile > **Authentication** > **Extensible Single sign-on (SSO)**).

The Company Portal app version will support the platform SSO settings for macOS 13 and later. Platform SSO allows you to sync your Microsoft Entra ID password to local accounts on Macs using the Enterprise Single Sign-On extension.

For more information on the Enterprise SSO plug-in, go to:

- [Use Intune to deploy the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices](../configuration/use-enterprise-sso-plug-in-ios-ipados-macos.md)
- [Entra ID and the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in overview for Apple devices](/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin)

Applies to:

- macOS 13 and later

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device enrollment

### New local primary account configuration for macOS automated device enrollment (ADE) <!-- 5877061 -->

Configure local primary account settings for Macs enrolling in Intune via Apple automated device enrollment (ADE). These settings, supported on devices running macOS 10.11 and later, will be available in new and existing enrollment profiles under the new **Account Settings** tab. For this feature to work, the enrollment profile must be configured with user-device affinity and one of the following authentication methods:

- Setup Assistant with modern authentication  
- Setup Assistant (legacy)  

### RBAC changes coming to enrollment settings for Windows Hello for Business<!-- 25661866   -->

We're updating RBAC in the enrollment area for Windows Hello for Business. Enrollment settings related to Windows Hello for Business will be read-only for all roles except the Intune Service Administrator. The Intune Service Administrator will be able to edit enrollment settings.

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device management

### End-user access to BitLocker Recovery Keys for enrolled Windows devices<!-- 8077173 -->

End-users will be able to view the BitLocker Recovery Key for enrolled Windows devices in the Web Company Portal. This capability will reduce helpdesk calls in the event they get locked out of their corporate machines. End users can access their enrolled Windows device's Recovery Key by clicking on **View Recovery Key** under their device after logging into the Web Company Portal. This is a similar experience to the MyAccount website which allows end users see their recovery keys as well.

Access to BitLocker recovery keys by end-users can be prevented when not allowed within your organization by using the Entra ID toggle **Restrict non-admin users from recovering the BitLocker key(s) for their owned device**. For more information about how to prevent access to BitLocker recovery keys, see [Manage device identities using the Microsoft Entra admin center](/entra/identity/devices/manage-device-identities).

### Introducing a remote action to pause the config refresh enforcement interval<!--24249019  -->

In the Windows Settings Catalog, you can configure **Config Refresh**. This feature lets you set a cadence for Windows devices to reapply previously received policy settings, without requiring devices to check in to Intune. The device will replay and re-enforce settings based on previously received policy to minimize the chance for configuration drift.

To support this feature, a remote action will be added to allow a pause in action. If an admin needs to make changes or run remediation on a device for troubleshooting or maintenance, they can issue a pause from Intune for a specified period. When the period expires, settings will be enforced again.

The remote action **Pause config refresh** can be accessed from the device summary page.

For information on currently available Remote actions, see [Remote actions](../remote-actions/device-management.md).

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device security

### New Microsoft Cloud PKI service<!-- 17272901  -->

We will soon release a new Microsoft Cloud PKI service to simplify and automate the certificate lifecycle management for Intune-managed devices. â€‹Microsoft Cloud PKI is a feature component of the Intune Suite and will also be available as a standalone [Intune add-ons](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md). It's a cloud-based service that provides a dedicated PKI infrastructure for your organization, and doesn't require on-premises servers, connectors, or hardware. The Microsoft Cloud PKI automatically issues, renews, and revokes certificates for all OS platforms supporting the SCEP certificate device configuration profile, which includes Windows, Android, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS. Issued certificates can be used for certificate-based authentication for Wi-Fi, VPN, and other services supporting certificate-based authentication.  

### HTML formatting supported in noncompliance email notifications <!-- 24197255   -->

HTML formatting will be supported in noncompliance email notifications for all platforms. You'll be able to use supported HTML tags to add formatting such as italics, URL links, and bulleted lists to your organization's messages.

### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You will be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

  Applies to:
  - Windows 10/11- - Available for the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform.
 
Prepare for February 2024. This policy change is expected to be released with the February 2024 service update for Intune. When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.
