# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information in this article:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users will not be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal<!-- 5145748 -->  
*The time frame for the release of this update is still being determined.*

Users will be able to uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal. If a Win32 app can be uninstalled by the user, the user will be able to select **Uninstall** for the Win32 app in the Company Portal. For more information about Win32 apps, go to [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Global quiet time app policy settings<!-- 15424417 -->  
The global quiet time settings will allow you to create policies to schedule quiet time for your end users, which will automatically mute Microsoft Outlook email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms. These policies can be used to limit end user notifications received after work hours. When this feature is available, you will be able to find it in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **Quiet Time** > **Policies**.

## Device configuration

### Disable Activation Lock device action for supervised iOS/iPadOS devices<!-- 15571509 -->  
You'll soon be able to use the **Disable Activation Lock** device action in Intune to bypass Activation Lock on iOS/iPadOS devices without requiring the current username or password.

This new action will be available under **Devices > iOS/iPadOS > select one of your listed devices > Disable Activation Lock**.

More information on managing Activation Lock is available at [Bypass iOS/iPadOS Activation Lock with Intune - Microsoft Intune | Microsoft Learn](../remote-actions/device-activation-lock-disable.md) or on Apple's website at [Activation Lock for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - Apple Support.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365).

Applies to:  
- **iOS/iPadOS**

### Support for multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS device inventory<!--16360290-->

You'll soon be able to view the service subscription fields on devices that have multiple SIM cards installed under the per-device Hardware section. The inventory fields that are capable of reporting multiple values to Intune are:

- **ICCID**
- **IMEI**
- **MEID**
- **Phone number**

These fields will default to using labels returned by the device, such as:  *Primary*, *Secondary*, *CTSubscriptionSlotOne*, and *CTSubscriptionSlotTwo*. These returned labels may be displayed in the language of the local device that is reporting its inventory to Intune.

Applies to:
- **iOS/iPadOS**

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device management

### View ServiceNow Incidents in the Intune Troubleshooting workspace<!-- 12508062  -->  
You'll soon be able to view a list of ServiceNow incidents associated with the user you've selected in the Intune Troubleshooting workspace. This new feature will be available under **Troubleshooting + Support** > select a user > **ServiceNow Incidents**. The list of incidents shown have a direct link back to the source incident and show key information from the incident. All incidents listed will link the "Caller" identified in the incident with the user selected for Troubleshooting.

For more information go to [Use the troubleshooting portal to help users at your company](help-desk-operators.md).

### On-demand proactive remediation for a Windows device<!-- 14783338  -->  
A new device action that is in public preview allows you to run a proactive remediation on-demand to a single Windows device. The **Run** remediation device action will allow you to resolve issues without having to wait for a proactive remediation to run on its assigned schedule. You will also be able to view the status of proactive remediations under **Remediations** in the **Monitor** section of a device.

### Endpoint security firewall rules support for ICMP type<!-- 5653356 -->  
We’re adding a new setting named **IcmpTypesAndCodes** to the endpoint security firewall rules template for Windows 10. To configure this in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create Policy** > Platform: *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server*  > Profile: *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules*).

With this new setting, you’ll be able to configure inbound and outbound rules for [Internet Control Message Protocol](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-an-inbound-icmp-rule) (ICMP) as part of a firewall rule.

Applies to:  
- Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Device security

### Support for tamper protection in policies for Security settings management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint <!-- 13204113 -->  
You’ll soon be able to manage Tamper protection for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on unenrolled devices as part of the [MDE Security configuration](../protect/mde-security-integration.md#which-solution-should-i-use) scenario.

When this support is available, your tamper protection configurations from *Windows Security Experience* profiles for *Antivirus* policies can apply to all devices instead of only to those that are enrolled with Intune.

Applies to:  
- Windows 10
- Windows 11
