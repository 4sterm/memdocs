# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information in this article:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users will not be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal<!-- 5145748 -->  
*The time frame for the release of this update is still being determined.*

Users will be able to uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal. If a Win32 app can be uninstalled by the user, the user will be able to select **Uninstall** for the Win32 app in the Company Portal. For more information about Win32 apps, go to [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Global quiet time app policy settings<!-- 15424417 -->  
The global quiet time settings will allow you to create policies to schedule quiet time for your end users, which will automatically mute Microsoft Outlook email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms. These policies can be used to limit end user notifications received after work hours. When this feature is available, you will be able to find it in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **Quiet Time** > **Policies**.

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device management

### Endpoint security firewall rules support for ICMP type<!-- 5653356 -->  
We’re adding a new setting named **IcmpTypesAndCodes** to the endpoint security firewall rules template for Windows 10. To configure this in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create Policy** > Platform: *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server*  > Profile: *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules*).

With this new setting, you’ll be able to configure inbound and outbound rules for [Internet Control Message Protocol](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-an-inbound-icmp-rule) (ICMP) as part of a firewall rule.

Applies to:  
- Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Device security

### Support for tamper protection in policies for Security settings management for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint <!-- 13204113 -->  
You’ll soon be able to manage Tamper protection for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on unenrolled devices as part of the [MDE Security configuration](../protect/mde-security-integration.md#which-solution-should-i-use) scenario.

When this support is available, your tamper protection configurations from *Windows Security Experience* profiles for *Antivirus* policies can apply to all devices instead of only to those that are enrolled with Intune.

Applies to:  
- Windows 10
- Windows 11
