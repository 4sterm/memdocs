# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information in this article:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal<!-- 5145748 -->  
Users will be able to uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal. If a Win32 app can be uninstalled by the user, the user will be able to select **Uninstall** for the Win32 app in the Company Portal. For more information about Win32 apps, go to [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Configure whether to show apps from Configuration Manager in Windows Company Portal<!-- 9135109 -->  
In the Intune console, you'll be able to choose whether to show or hide Configuration Manager apps from appearing in the Windows Company Portal. This option will be available in [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Tenant administration** > **Customization**. Next to **Settings**, select **Edit**. The option to **Show** or **Hide** the **Configuration Manager applications will be located in the **App Sources** section of the pane. For related information about configuring the Company Portal app, see [How to configure the Intune Company Portal apps, Company Portal website, and Intune app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Global quiet time app policy settings<!-- 15424417 -->  
The global quiet time settings will allow you to create policies to schedule quiet time for your end users which will automatically mute Microsoft Outlook email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms. These policies can be used to limit end user notifications received after work hours. When this feature is available, you will be able to find it in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **Quiet Time** > **Policies**.

## Device configuration

### New password complexity requirements for Android Enterprise 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 12436068 -->  
On Android Enterprise 11 and older personally owned devices with a work profile, you can set the **Required password type** and a **Minimum password length** in device configuration profiles and compliance policies.

Google is deprecating these features for Android 12+ personally owned devices with a work profile and replacing them with new password complexity requirements. For more information about this change, go to [Day zero support for Android 13](https://aka.ms/Intune/Android13).

The new **Password complexity** setting will have the following options:

- **Not configured**: Intune doesn't change or update this setting. By default, the OS may not require a password.
- **Low**: Pattern or PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked.
- **Medium**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length, alphabetic length, or alphanumeric length must be at least 4 characters.
- **High**: PIN with repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequences are blocked. The length must be at least 8 characters. The alphabetic or alphanumeric length must be at least 6 characters.

If you currently use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings in your device configuration and compliance policies on Android 12+, then we recommend using the new **Password complexity** setting instead.

If you continue to use the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings, and don't configure the **Password complexity** setting, then new devices running Android 12+ will default to the **High** password complexity.

There is no impact for existing devices with the **Required password type** and **Minimum password length** settings configured.

For more information on the existing settings you can configure, go to:

- [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile - configuration profile settings list](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md)
- [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile - compliance policy settings list](../protect/compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md#personally-owned-work-profile)

Applies to:  
- Android 12.0 and newer
- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

## Device management

### Endpoint security firewall rules support for ICMP type<!-- 5653356 -->  
We’re adding a new setting named **IcmpTypesAndCodes** to the endpoint security firewall rules template for Windows 10. To configure this in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Endpoint security** > **Firewall** > **Create Policy** > Platform: *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server*  > Profile: *Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules*).

With this new setting you’ll be able to configure inbound and outbound rules for [Internet Control Message Protocol](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/create-an-inbound-icmp-rule) (ICMP) as part of a firewall rule.

Applies to:  
- Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Device security

### Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management for Android (public preview)<!-- 15769204  -->  
In a public preview, we’re adding support for Mobile Application Management (MAM) to the Microsoft Tunnel VPN gateway. With this preview for Android devices that have not enrolled with Intune, supported apps will be able to use Microsoft Tunnel to connect to your organization when working with corporate data and resources. This includes VPN gateway support for:  

- Secure access to on-prem apps and resources using modern authentication
- Single Sign On and conditional access.

To use Tunnel for MAM on an unenrolled device will require the following three profiles:  

- An App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Defender on devices for use as the Tunnel client app 
- A second App configuration profile for managed apps, to configure Microsoft Edge to connect to Tunnel.
- An App protection profile to enable automatic start of the Microsoft Tunnel connection

For information about using Tunnel on enrolled devices, see [Microsoft Tunnel overview](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-overview.md)

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise

## Tenant administration

### Deliver organizational messages for Windows 11 (public preview)<!-- 15314747 -->  

Deliver branded personalized messages to employees just above their taskbar, in their Notifications, or when they run the Get Started app on Windows 11 devices. Organizational messages are intended to improve employee communication in remote and hybrid-work scenarios, and to help employees adapt to their new roles more quickly, learn more about their organization, and stay informed of new updates and trainings.
