# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### View app report for Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices<!-- 2055436  -->  
You'll be able to view a report containing all apps found on a device for Android Enterprise corporate-owned scenarios, including system apps. This report will be available in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **Monitor** > **Discovered apps**. You will see **Application Name** and **Version** for all apps detected as installed on the device.

### Advanced application management<!-- 10986080  -->  
Advanced application management provides you with an enterprise catalog of applications that are easily accessible. It also provides application update capabilities. The enterprise catalog is planned to be available in public preview in late Q2 2023. The application update capabilities are planned to be available in early Q3 2023.

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users won't be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal<!-- 5145748 -->  
*The time frame for the release of this update is still being determined.*

Users will be able to uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal. If a Win32 app can be uninstalled by the user, the user will be able to select **Uninstall** for the Win32 app in the Company Portal. For more information about Win32 apps, go to [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

## Device configuration

### Wipe device action and new obliteration behavior setting available for macOS<!-- 16647226  -->  
You'll soon be able to use the **Wipe** device action instead of Erase for macOS devices. Additionally, you'll be able to configure the **Obliteration Behavior** setting as part of the **Wipe** action.

This new key allows you to control the wipe fallback behavior on Macs that have Apple Silicon or the T2 Security Chip. To find this setting, navigate to **Devices** > **macOS** > [Select a device] > **Overview** > **Wipe** in the **Device action** area.

For more information on the Obliteration Behavior setting, go to Apple's Platform Deployment site [Erase Apple devices - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/erase-devices-dep0a819891e/web).

Applies to:

- macOS

### Support for multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS device inventory<!--17016690 (replaced 16360290 for tracking -->

You'll be able to view the service subscription fields on devices that have multiple SIM cards installed under the per-device Hardware section. The inventory fields that are capable of reporting multiple values to Intune are:

- **ICCID**
- **IMEI**
- **MEID**
- **Phone number**

These fields will default to using labels returned by the device, such as:  *Primary*, *Secondary*, *CTSubscriptionSlotOne*, and *CTSubscriptionSlotTwo*. These returned labels may be displayed in the language of the local device that is reporting its inventory to Intune.

Applies to:  
- **iOS/iPadOS**

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device enrollment

### Apple Account Driven User Enrollment available for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices<!-- 14161683  -->  
Intune will support Apple Account Driven User Enrollment, a new and improved variation of Apple User Enrollment for iOS/iPadOS 15+ devices. The new option will utilize just-in-time-registration, which eliminates the need for the Company Portal app during enrollment. Device users can initiate enrollment directly in the Settings app, resulting in a shorter and more efficient onboarding experience. You can continue to target iOS/iPadOS devices using the existing profile-based User Enrollment method with Company Portal. Devices running iOS/iPadOS, version 14.8.1 and earlier will be unaffected by this update and can also continue to use the existing method.

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device management

### On-demand proactive remediation for a Windows device<!-- 14783338  -->  
A new device action that is in public preview allows you to run a proactive remediation on-demand to a single Windows device. The **Run** remediation device action will allow you to resolve issues without having to wait for a proactive remediation to run on its assigned schedule. You'll also be able to view the status of proactive remediations under **Remediations** in the **Monitor** section of a device.
