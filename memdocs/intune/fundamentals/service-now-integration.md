# ServiceNow Integration with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](../includes/azure_portal.md)]

Remote Help, an add-on to Microsoft Intune is the first solution offered in the series of advanced endpoint management solutions launched. Remote Help provides a secure, and cloud based remote assistance solution for Windows commercial users. The integration between Intune and ServiceNow makes it possible for helpdesk agents to use Intune to troubleshoot endpoint related issues.

Support organizations need all the tools at their disposal to resolve workersâ€™ technology issues quickly and efficiently. The ServiceNow integration will enable helpdesk agents who are licensed to use Remote Help and who use ServiceNow to view incidents to see the details of the tech issue that an employee is facing. This integration allows helpdesk agents to view ServiceNow incidents directly from the Troubleshooting pane in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## About ServiceNow connector Integration

ServiceNow is a 3rd party platform for IT Service Management and helps to automate IT Business Management. For more information on ServiceNow go to:

- [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/)  

The Intune ServiceNow Connector Integration focuses on the basic ticketing flow to enable support/IT admin to view the history of ServiceNow incidents in the MEM portal, device Inventory, MEM insights enhanced ticket flows, and software licensing and reclamation.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need the following:

- During the Preview, no additional licenses or subscriptions are required.  After the ServiceNow integration becomes Generally Available, an active Remote Help trial or add-on license is required.  Go to [Remote Help trial or add-on license.](../premium-add-ons.md)

- You must have the AAD Global Admin Role or AAD Intune Admin role to make updates to the connector. To view the incidents, you must have the AAD Global Admin Role or AAD Intune Admin role or have an Intune Role with the Organization | Read permission. For information on  roles, see [Role-based administration control (RBAC) with Intune](role-based-access-control.md)

- To configure the ServiceNow connector to establish a connection between Intune and your ServiceNow instance. See the steps outlined in [Configure the ServiceNow integration with Microsoft Intune](#configure-the-servicenow-integration-with-microsoft-intune).  

## Configure the ServiceNow integration with Microsoft Intune

1. Sign into Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center and go to **Tenant Administration > Connectors and Tokens > ServiceNow connector**.
2. You can see the **Connection Status** and the **Last Connection** date time stamp.
3. Use the toggle to either turn on or off the ability to **Exchange data with the ServiceNow instance**.
4. Next, define the following properties for how you are going to connect with ServiceNow.

     | Field           | Description                                                                                                                         |
     |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
     | ServiceNow Instance Host             | A URL that points to your organization's ServiceNow instance. For example, 'https://contoso.service-now.com'   |
     | ServiceNow Incident API URL         | The table in the ServiceNow database that contains incidents. Incidents are retrieved from this table.  For example, api/now/table/incident                           |
     | ServiceNow Client appID     | The unique identifier assigned in ServiceNow to the application used to represent Intune. Provide the client id of the app. You need to have a client app created in ServiceNow to copy over the appID and use it here to establish the connection. Go to [How to create a ServiceNow app](#how-to-create-a-servicenow-app).                                 |

5. Click **Test connection** to verify if your settings are correct. You will see a verification message to connect to your ServiceNow account. Click **Allow**.
6. The **Connection Status** field is updated and now displays Verified.
7. Click **Save** to save your connection settings.
8. With this the ServiceNow connector is configured successfully. Let's see how to use it in the [ServiceNow incident view in Microsoft Intune](#servicenow-incident-view-in-microsoft-intune).

### How to create a ServiceNow app

In your ServiceNow developer instance you'll need to:
 
- create a new OAuth application
- create a new CORS Rule

To create a new OAuth application,

1. In the developer instance, click **All** and navigate to **System OAuth > Application Registry**.
1. Set up a new OAuth application.
1. Complete the following OAuth client application details and click **Save**.

     | Field           | Description                                                                                                                         |
     |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
     | Client ID            | The ServiceNow OAuth server automatically generates the ClientID.   |
     | Client Secret         | Client Secret for the OAuth generation. Leave it empty for auto-generation. This value is used as an input in the **ServiceNow client appID** field for the ServiceNow connector configuration.                           |
     | Redirect URL     | The authorization server redirects to this URL. They must be an absolute URL and comma separated. For example, you can set the URL to 'https://endpoint.microsoft.com/TokenAuthorize/ExtensionName/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings'                       |
     | Logo URL           | Provide the URL to the publicly hosted company logo, which will be displayed when authenticating with ServiceNow. For example, you can set it to: 'https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-SJfnMq3/0/XL/i-SJfnMq3-XL.png'    |
     | Application        | By default, set to **Global** and is not editable when creating the OAuth app.                           |
     | Accessible from    | By default, set to **All application scopes**.                       |
     | Active    | Select the checkbox.                       |
     | Refresh Token Lifespan    | Enter the max time for which the refresh token will remain valid in seconds.                       |
     | Access Token Lifespan    | Enter the max time for which the access token will remain valid in seconds . The recommend setting is 15 minutes. A warning message will appear If configured higher than 15 minutes.                       |

To create a new CORS rule,

1. In the developer instance, click **All** and navigate to **System Web Services > Rest> CORS Rules**.
2. Create a new CORS rule. Configure CORS rules to allow cross-domain requests to REST APIs from a browser-based application in a different domain.
3. Complete the following CORS rule details and click **Save**.

     | Field           | Description                                                                                                |
     |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
     | Application      | By default, this is set to **Global** and is not editable.   |
     | REST API        | Set to Table API .                           |
     | Domain    | Set the domain. For example, 'https://*.portal.azure.net'                                 |
     | HTTP Methods    | Select GET and POST.                                 |

> [!NOTE]
> CORS rules can take up to 30 minutes to propagate.

## ServiceNow incident view in Microsoft Intune
