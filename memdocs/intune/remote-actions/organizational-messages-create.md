# Create organizational messages  

*Applies to Windows 11*  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is in public preview. For more information, see [Public preview in Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/public-preview.md).  

Create, edit, and monitor [organizational messages](organizational-messages-overview.md) in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. You can send important messages and call-to-actions to employees on Windows 11 devices managed by Microsoft Intune. 

This article describes how to create the following types of organizational messages: 

 * Taskbar messages  
 * Notification area messages  
 * Get Started app messages  

## Before you create a message   
Complete these steps before creating a message.  
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Go to  **Tenant administration** > **Organizational messages (preview)**. 
3. Spend some time in the **Overview** tab to learn about messaging options and prerequisites. For more information about the steps you need to take before you create a message, see [Prerequisites](organizational-messages-prerequisites.md).   

## Step 1: Create a message  

# [Taskbar](#tab/taskbar)  
Create and configure a message for the taskbar area.  
1. Go to the **Message** tab and select **Create**.  
2. For **Message type**, select **Taskbar**.   
3. For **Message theme**, select **Mandatory update**. This type of message prompts employees to install a mandatory update.   
4. Select **OK**.  
5. On the **Message** page, select **Add a logo**, and then choose an image file. For requirements, see [Logo requirements](organizational-messages-prerequisites.md#logo-requirements).  
6. (Optional) **Provide a link for the message**: To include a URL link in your message:  
   * Select the domain you want to use. The list contains all Azure AD verified custom domain names in your tenant. Example: `www.contoso.com` 
   * (Optional) Select **Add a link path, if needed** and add the path for your URL. Example: `/SoftwareUpdate`   
   * Select the full generated link to make sure it works. Example: `www.contoso.com/SoftwareUpdate`     
7. **Choose language to preview**: Select a language to preview the localized version of your message. The message is shown to employees in the [display language](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-the-input-and-display-language-settings-in-windows-12a10cb4-8626-9b77-0ccb-5013e0c7c7a2) they've selected on their device. Organizational messages are supported in 15 languages. If the employee's preferred language isn't supported, the message will appear in their preferred fallback language.  
8. **Preview the message in dark theme**: Turn on the toggle to view how your message appears in dark theme. Check to make sure your logo shows up correctly in both light and dark theme.  
9. Select **Next: Schedule** to continue to scheduling options.

## Step 2: Schedule a message  

# [Taskbar / Notification area](#tab/taskbar+notification) 
On the **Schedule** page, schedule the delivery of your message. 

1. Configure the delivery time window. Your options:  

   * **First day to show message**: Select when to first show the message. To ensure that delivery begins when you want it to, configure this setting 24 hours before you want the message to appear.   
   * **Last day to show message**:  Select the last day to show the message. This date must be at least 7 days after the start date.   
2. Select **Next: Assignments** to continue to assignment options.   

# [Get Started app](#tab/get-started)  
On the **Schedule** page, schedule the delivery of your message.  

1. Configure the **Message repeat frequency**. Select how often you want the message to reappear after employees dismiss it. The message will initially go away when the employee dismisses it or completes the call-to-action, but will reappear at the frequency you select here. Your options: 
   * **Once a week**
   * **Once every two weeks**
   * **Once a month**  
2. Turn on the **Always on** toggle to make messages visible in the Get Started app.  
3. Select **Next: Assignments** to continue to assignment options.

## Step 3: Assign message  
Assign the message to Azure AD-registered users in your organization. You can only assign messages to Azure AD user groups, not Azure AD device groups. If a group includes both users and devices, Intune will only send the message to the users. 

1. To include groups in the assignment, you have two options:    
   * **Add groups**: Select this option to individually choose from a list of Azure AD groups.  
   * **Include all users**: Select the option to assign the message to all Azure AD-registered users.  
2. If needed, exclude Azure AD groups from the assignment. Under **Exclude**, select **Add groups** and choose the Azure AD groups to leave out.  
3. Select **Next: Review + Create** to review and finalize your message.  

## Step 4: Review and create message  
Review your message, scheduling details, and assignments before creating your message. When you're ready to send the message, select **Create**. 

Return to **Organizational messages (preview)** and select the **Message** tab to view and edit your new message.  

## Next steps  
* Monitor and track the status and user engagement details for scheduled organizational messages. For more information, see [View reporting details for organizational messages](organizational-messages-reporting.md).  
* [Cancel an organizational message](organizational-messages-cancel.md) that's no longer needed.
