# Microsoft Edge for Business end user experience 

Now that we have configured Microsoft Entra conditional access policy and created our first app protection policy for windows, we can launch **Microsoft Edge for Business** in a manage or unmanage device.

The end user experience for Secure Enterprise Browser in Microsoft Edge for Business is designed to be productive, secure, and user-friendly:

1. **Visually Distinct Work Browsing Experience**: Microsoft Edge for Business provides a visually distinct work browsing experience with refreshed visual treatment. This helps users easily distinguish between their work and personal browsing sessions.

2. **Enterprise Personal Browsing Experience**: Microsoft Edge for Business offers a lightly managed personal browsing experience that lets users access their favorite nonwork sites and services without compromising safety for the enterprise.Â It also automatically switches from work-related navigation into the work browser.

3. **Automatic Switching**: This feature helps enforce context separation between work and personal browsing. It ensures that work-related content doesn't get intermingled with personal browsing, preventing users from accidentally sharing sensitive information with unintended audiences.

4. **Company Branding**: This feature, which is coming soon, will increase familiarity and trust with company branding in the work browser window.

5. **Security**: It has powerful, built-in defenses against phishing and malware and natively supports hardware isolation on Windows.

In conclusion, Microsoft Edge for Business provides dedicated work browsing experience that is visually distinct, secure, and user-friendly. It separates work and personal browsing into dedicated browser windows with their own favorites, separate cache, and storage locations.

### **Enrollment Experience**

To evaluate the enrollment experience, we'll launch **Microsoft Edge** from the Desktop and perform the sign-in process into the browser for the first time. It's important to consider that the device can't be managed by any MDM Solution, otherwise we won't be able to enroll into the MAM Service.

1. Locate **Microsoft Edge** on the desktop.

2. Select on the **Microsoft Edge** icon and wait for it to load, once loaded select on the right side where the User Icon is located.
