# Manage Company Portal preferences for macOS 

Select your preferences for single sign-on and in-app data collection in Company Portal. To access your preferences:  

1. Open the Company Portal app.
2. Go to the menu bar and select **Company Portal** > **Preferences**.  

## Platform single sign-on  
The Platform single sign-on (SSO) extension configures a work or school device so that while you're using it, you only have to authenticate once to access all apps and services. To enable PSSO, go to Action Center and select the notification prompting for registration. Then follow the onscreen steps to register your device.  

Platform SSO is available on Macs that support PSSO, which is determined by your organization. The Company Portal preferences for Platform SSO become available after you register on the Mac with your work or school account. They include:  

**Sign out**: Remove your work or school account from this device. This action signs you out of your account on the device and clears Platform SSO extension tokens.  
**Deregister**: Remove Platform SSO registration from this device. To access protected resources again on this device, you must register with Platform SSO.    

To opt out of Platform SSO, select the checkbox next to **Don't ask me to sign in with Platform SSO for this device**. 


## Single sign-on   
The single sign-on (SSO) extension configures your work or school account so that you only have to authenticate once to access all apps and services within your organization's network. 

Options include:  

**Register device**: 
**Remove account from this device**: Remove your work or school account from this device. This action signs you out of your account on the device and clears SSO extension tokens.  

To opt out of SSO on your Mac, select the checkbox next to **Don't ask me to sign in with single sign-on for this device**.  


## Send usage data to Microsoft    

This setting enables Microsoft to collect data about your Intune Company Portal usage. When the checkbox is selected, your in-app performance and usage data is automatically anonymized and shared with Microsoft to help improve the reliability and performance of our products. Your organization doesn't have control over the collection of this data and cannot change your preference.  

To turn off data collection in Company Portal, clear the checkbox next to **Allow Microsoft to collect usage data**.  

## Advanced logging

Select the checkbox next to **Turn on advanced logging** to turn on detailed logging for troubleshooting. Company Portal logs certificate usage details when advanced logging is turned on. Advanced logging is turned off by default. Keep this setting turned off unless otherwise instructed by your organization's IT administrator.
