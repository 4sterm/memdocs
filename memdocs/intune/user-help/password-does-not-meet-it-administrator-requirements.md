# Add or change device password on Intune-enrolled device    

 **Applies to**:  
 * Windows 10  
 * Windows 11  
 * Android  
 * iOS/iPadOS  
 * macOS  

You'll receive a message from Company Portal if your device password, PIN, or passcode doesn't meet your organization's security requirements. Password requirements are put in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to the work or school data on your enrolled device. Until you create a more secure device password, you may be blocked from accessing your org's network.  

## Change password, passcode, PIN
