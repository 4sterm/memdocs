# Sync your Windows device manually  

**Applies to**  
- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  

Sync the enrolled device you're using for work to get the latest updates, requirements, and communications from your organization. Company Portal regularly syncs devices as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection. However, if you ever need to disconnect for an extended period of time, you can manually sync the device when you return to get any updates you missed. 
 
Syncing can also help resolve work-related downloads or other processes that are in progress or stalled. If you're experiencing slow or unusual behavior while installing or using a work app, try syncing your device to see if an update or requirement is missing.  

You can start a sync from the Company Portal app, desktop taskbar or Start menu, and from the device Settings app. Company Portal app functionality is supported on Windows 10 devices running the Creator's Update (1703) or later, and Windows 11.  

All devices running Windows can be synced from the Settings app.  

## Sync from Company Portal app for Windows
Complete these steps to sync your Windows 10/11 device.  

1. Open the Company Portal app on your device.

2. Select **Settings** > **Sync**.

## Sync from device taskbar or Start menu   

You can also access the sync control outside of the app, from your device's desktop. This way is useful if you have the app pinned directly to your taskbar or Start menu, and want to quickly sync.  

1. Find the Company Portal app icon in your taskbar or Start menu.  
2. Right-click the app's icon so its menu (also referred to as a jump list) appears.

3. Select **Sync this device**. The **Settings** page opens in the Company Portal app and the sync begins.  

## Sync from Settings app  
Complete these steps to manually sync devices from the system Settings app.
