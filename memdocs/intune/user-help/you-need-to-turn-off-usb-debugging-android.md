# Turn off USB debugging mode 

To turn off USB debugging mode:  
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Tap **System** > **Developer options**. 
2. Go to **USB debugging** and flip the switch to turn it off. 
3. Wait a few minutes for the changes to register on your device before you try accessing your work or school resources.  

You can also type **USB debugging** in the search bar to go directly to the setting.  

For the most up-to-date instructions, see the help documentation provided by the device manufacturer.  

## What is USB debugging?  

_USB debugging_ is often used by developers or IT support people to connect and transfer data from an Android device to a computer. While this feature is useful, a device isn't as secure when connected to a computer. So that's why some organizations require you to turn this setting off.
