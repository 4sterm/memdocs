# Upload and email logs  

There are different ways to report a problem or error that occurs in the Microsoft Intune and Intune Company Portal apps for Android. When an error occurs:

* You can share diagnostic logs with Microsoft. You won't get a personal response but you do receive an incident ID.  
* You can loop in your support person via email and share your incident ID with them for follow-up.  

This article describes how to send app logs from the Company Portal and Microsoft Intune apps, and how to access logs in the work profile. 

## What you need to know  
Turn on _verbose logging_ in Company Portal to make it easier for your support person to investigate errors. For more information, see [Configure logging settings](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).  

The send logs option in the Company Portal is unavailable for sovereign cloud environments.  

## Send logs from Company Portal  

1. There are two ways to initiate email support in the app:
   
    * From the home screen, tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Send logs**.    
    * From an error message, tap **HELP** or **SEND INFO**, if available.  

    > [!TIP]
    > **Menu** appears as a software button or a hardware button, depending on the Android device you have.  

2. Tap **SEND LOGS, THEN EMAIL**.  
3. The app sends your logs. Open your email app when prompted.   
4. An email message opens with the incident ID pre-populated in the subject field. 
    1. Enter your support person's email address. 
    2. Describe the problem that you came across. 
    3. Send the email and follow-up with your organization if needed. 

## Send logs from Microsoft Intune app   

1. In the Microsoft Intune app, there are two ways to initiate email support.  
    * From the home screen: Tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Get Support**.  
    * From an error message: Tap **HELP** or **SEND INFO**, if available.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3. Tap **UPLOAD LOGS**.  
4. After the upload is complete, tap **EMAIL** and select your email app.  
5. An email message will open with the incident ID pre-populated in the subject field. In the body of the email, describe the problem that you came across.  

## Save logs to share with your support person
You must have a file viewing app to save and share Company Portal logs. If you're on a device with a work profile, the file viewing app needs to be in the work profile.  

1. Go to your work profile and open Company Portal.  
2. Tap **Settings**.  
3. Tap **SAVE LOGS**. When prompted to, choose where you want to save the logs.  
4. Share the logs with your support person as needed.
