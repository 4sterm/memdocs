# Report Company Portal app problems  

Get help or report a problem with the Company Portal app. Company Portal provides you with an email template and helps you upload and share diagnostic details. You can share diagnostic details with both your support person and Microsoft app developers.   

## Get help from support  
For troubleshooting and support, report the problem to your support person. Reproduce the problem if you can and then follow these steps when you receive the error message:     

1. In the Company Portal app, go to the menu bar and select the **Help** menu > **Save Diagnostic Report**. 
2. Choose a location to save the file. 
3. Open your email app and attach the diagnostics file to a new email.   
6. In the body of the email, describe the steps you took right up until the error occurred. 
7. Send the email to your support person, and follow up with them after the email if needed.      

## Share diagnostic details 

You can share the diagnostic details about an error with Microsoft. Microsoft uses the Company Portal-specific logs to learn from and improve upon future products. 

First, try to reproduce the problem so that you receive the error message again. Then select **Report** to immediately upload and share the diagnostic logs. 

If the error message can't be reproduced, you can access the diagnostics options from the Help menu.   

1. Go to the Company Portal menu bar and select **Help**. 
2. Select **Send diagnostic report**.  

## Contact information  
To find your organization's contact information, sign in to the Company Portal app or [website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) and select **Support**.
