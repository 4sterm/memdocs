# Device enrollment help for Apple devices   

**Applies to:**  
* iOS/iPadOS
* macOS  

## Find serial number  

The serial number for your device uniquely identifies it, and can help your IT support person during troubleshooting or support tasks, such as replacing your device with a new one. For more information and steps for your Apple device, see [Find the serial number of your Apple product](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102858).  

## Reconnect compromised iOS device

A *jailbroken* device means that the device has been changed to enable unrestricted access to certain critical files, which can compromise security and be a threat to work or school data.  \When this happens, your iOS/iPadOS device loses access to work or school resources. You likely need to reset your device to factory settings. We recommend that you contact your IT support person for help.
