# Compliance and setting requirements for iOS/iPadoS devices          

**Applies to iOS/iPadOS**  

This article describes the iOS/iPadOS device setting requirements that the Intune Company Portal can enforce on behalf of your workplace or school. These requirements help keep your device secure while you're using it for work or school purposes.    

## Device limit reached    

To prevent unauthorized access to internal data, your school or workplace might limit the number of devices you can register. If you reach the device limit, we recommend removing one of your devices or contacting your support person to increase the device limit. Your options:  

* Remove a device in Company Portal.  
* Contact your IT support person and ask if they can increase the number of devices you're allowed to register.  

## Identify device  

If you're prompted to identify your device during enrollment, at least one of your devices has already been enrolled and assigned to your account using a method other than the Company Portal app. Select your device from the list in Company Portal to identify it. 

If your device isn't listed:  
1. Select **new device**.  
2. Select **Continue**.
3. Enter the last four characters of your device's serial number. For more information, see [Find the serial number of your Apple product](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102858) on Apple Support.

## Update operating system version  
Keeping your device up-to-date lets you access the newest features, and it also ensures that your device has the most secure version of its operating system. While using the device for work or school, we recommend keeping both personal and corporate devices up-to-date with the newest versions. Before updating your device, back up all of the information on it. Keeping a backup can help you recover your data if something should interrupt any updates, or lets you transfer your information to a replacement device.  

To check your device for available software updates, go to **Settings**  and tap **General** > **Software Update**.  

## Operating system isn't supported  
The operating system (OS) version that's on your device isn't supported. It's possible that the latest version of iOS/iPadOS doesn't work with your organization's apps, tools, and other internal infrastructure. To resolve this issue, contact your IT support person and find out what the OS requirements are for your device.   

## Reconnect compromised device  
A *jailbroken* device is a device that has been altered to enable unrestricted access to certain critical files. Jailbroken devices can compromise security and cause a threat to work or school data. If Company Portal detects a jailbroken device, it revokes access to work or school resources. You likely need to reset your device to factory settings to return your device to its original configuration. We recommend that you contact your IT support person for help and other possible options.
