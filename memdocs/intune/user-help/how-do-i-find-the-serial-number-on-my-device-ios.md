# Device enrollment help for Apple devices   

**Applies to:**

Learn more about the device compliance and enrollment messages you receive in the Intune Company Portal app. The topics described in this article are applicable to iPhones, iPads, and Macs.      

## Find serial number  

The serial number for your device uniquely identifies it. It can be helpful to provide this ID to your IT support person during troubleshooting or support tasks, such as replacing your device with a new one. For more information, see [Find the serial number of your Apple product](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102858) on Apple Support.  

## Reconnect compromised iOS device

A *jailbroken* device means that the device has been changed to enable unrestricted access to certain critical files. Jailbroken devices can compromise security and cause a threat to work or school data. If this occurs, your device loses access to work or school resources. You likely need to reset your device to factory settings. We recommend that you contact your IT support person for help.
