# Check status on Intune Company Portal website 
View and check device status on the Intune Company Portal website.   During a status check, Company Portal confirms that the settings on your device meet your organization's requirements and confirms whether or not you have access to their resources. Company Portal performs device check-ins regularly and automatically, but you can manually initiate one to:    

* Register recent changes you made to device settings.  
* Refresh an outdated device status.  
* Resolve a pending requirement.  

## Device status   

Company Portal shows the following statuses:  

* **Can access**: Your device is allowed to access work or school resources.  
* **Cannot access company resources**: Your device isn't allowed to access work or school resources. Make the required changes shown on the Company Portal website to gain access.  


## Check device status  
To check the status of a device:  

1. Sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).  

2. Select **Devices**, and then select your device.  

3. Under **Status**, tap **Check status**. Wait while Company Portal checks your device. 

After the check, your device status changes to show the most current state of your device. If you're required to make any changes to the settings, Company Portal will include that information on the same screen.
