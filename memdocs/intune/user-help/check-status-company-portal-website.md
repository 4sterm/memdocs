# Check status on Intune Company Portal website 
View and check device status on the Intune Company Portal website.   During a status check, Company Portal confirms that the settings on your device meet your organization's requirements and shows whether or not you have access to their resources. Company Portal performs device check-ins regularly and automatically, but you can manually initiate one to:    

* Register recent changes you made to device settings.  
* Refresh an outdated device status.  
* Resolve a pending requirement or issue.  

## Check status  
To check the status of a device:  

1. Sign in to the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).  

2. Select **Devices**, and then select your device.  

3. Under **Status**, select **Check status**. Wait while Company Portal checks your device.  

## Status descriptions  

After the check, the status updates to show the most current state of your device. Possible statuses include:   

* **Can access**: Your device is allowed to access work or school resources.  
* **Out of compliance - can still access company resources**: You device is allowed to access work or school resources, but one or more settings don't meet your organization's requirements. Update your device settings by the date shown to keep your access.  
* **Cannot access company resources**: Your device isn't allowed to access work or school resources. Make the required changes to gain access.  

If you're required to make any changes to the settings, Company Portal will include that information on the same screen.
