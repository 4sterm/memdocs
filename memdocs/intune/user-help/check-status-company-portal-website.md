# Check status on Intune Company Portal website 
View and check device status on the Intune Company Portal website. Th device status reveals whether or not your device is compliant with your organization's requirements.  Device check-ins are performed automatically but you can manually initiate one to: 

* Register changes you just made to your device
* Refresh your device status 
* Regain access to your work or school resources 

This article describes how to check device status on the Company Portal website. 

## Device status 

During a status check, Company Portal confirms that the settings on your device meet your organization's policy requirements, and changes the device status to reflect whether or not you're in compliance. Statuses include:

* **Compliant**: The device can access work or school resources.  
* **In grace**:  The device can access work or school resources for now, but the device doesn't meet requirements. Make the required changes before the given date to maintain access. 
* **Not in compliance**: The device cannot access work or school resources. Make the required changes to regain access.  

Check-ins are important for maintaining secure access to your organization's resources. 
If you recently made changes to your device settings, you may need to manually check the status to register your changes with Company Portal. 

## Check device status  

1. Sign in to the Company Portal website.  

2. Select **Devices**, and then select your device.  

3. Under **Status**, tap **Check status**. Wait while Company Portal checks your device. 

4. After the check, your device status reflects the most current state of your device. If you're required to make any changes, a message will appear at the top of the screen. Select it for more details.
