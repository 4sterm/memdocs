# Resolve Company Portal compliance issues on Macs with Self Service 
**Applies to macOS**  

This article is for employees and students setting up a Mac for work or school, and describes how to resolve device compliance issues in Self Service. The Intune Company Portal app flags Jamf Pro-managed devices for the following compliance issues:  

* Account not onboarded.  
* Device is already enrolled.

These issues are caused by policy conflicts between Company Portal and Self Service. Complete thse recommended steps to resolve these compliance issues and regain access to work or school data on your Mac.  

1. Open the Self Service app on the Mac you're setting up for work.
2. Close the Company Portal app.  
3. In Self Service, install the pending device registration policy from your organization. Select the policy to install it.
4. Open the Company Portal app again and under **Devices**, select your Mac.
5. Choose **Check access** to rerun the compliance check and resolve the issue.   

For additional help, contact your IT support person. Sign into the Intune Company Portal app or [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) and go to **Help & support** for contact information.
