# Change User Access Control setting  

The User Access Control settings help prevent potentially harmful programs and software from making changes to your device. If you've received a message about adjusting these controls, it means that your organization requires your device to have more protection from User Access Control.

## Adjust protection level    

1. Go to **Start** and open **Control Panel**.
2. Select **System and Security**.
3. Under **Security and Maintenance**, select **Change User Account Control settings**.
3. Move the slider to one of the following levels: 
   * **Notify me when apps try to make changes to my computer**
   * **Always notify**  
4. Select **OK** to save your changes. 
5. Select **Yes** when prompted to confirm the changes.  

## Check device settings  
After you make changes to User Account Control, return to Company Portal and sync your device. 

1. Open Company Portal for Windows.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Select **Sync**.
