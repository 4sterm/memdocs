# Check compliance on your AOSP device  

Manually start a device check-in from the Microsoft Intune app to:

* Force the Intune app to check device compliance 
* Update your device status 
* Regain access to your work or school resources 

## Purpose of check-in 

During a check-in, the Intune app confirms that the settings on your device meet your organization's policy requirements. Your organization can limit or restrict access to work or school resources until you check in.  

If you recently made changes to your device settings, you may need to manually check in to register these changes with Company Portal. 

## Check compliance  
Complete these steps to check device settings or refresh your compliance status. 

1. Open the Microsoft Intune app for AOSP on your device.   

2. Tap **Devices** and then select your device.  

3. Under **Device Settings Status**, tap **Refresh**. 
    
    The Intune app will check your device to confirm that it's meeting your organization's setting requirements. 

4. After the check, your device settings status will either read, **In Compliance** or **Not in Compliance**. 

    If you're required to make any changes, a message will appear at the top of the screen. Tap it for more details.
