# Set up Datalert app for Android  

Workplaces use telecom expense management software to ensure that data and voice plans are being used within acceptable limits. If your organization monitors telecom usage, you may be required to install the Datalert app on your enrolled device. This article describes how to install and set up Datalert on your device. 

## Install app and sign in    
After enrollment, tap the notification sent to your device to install the [Datalert app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.memobox.databox) from the Google Play store. 

If you don't receive a notification, you can still install Datalert from Google Play, but instead of using your work or school account, you must provide your phone number and verify your device using a code. Contact your support person for more information about the code.

Once you've set up your account with Datalert, you can begin monitoring your data usage by day, week, and month in the app. Your organization can monitor your voice and data plan to prevent overages and unexpected roaming costs.

### Set up with work or school account  
Use your Microsoft work or school account to set up Datalert on your device.  

1. Open Datalert and select __Enroll with Microsoft account__.

2. Select your Microsoft work or school account. If it's not listed, select **Add account** to sign in manually.
