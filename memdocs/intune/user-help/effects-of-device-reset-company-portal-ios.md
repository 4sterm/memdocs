# Reset device in Company Portal app for iOS  

Use the Company Portal app for iOS to reset a used, lost, or stolen device back to factory settings. All apps, settings, and personal data on the device will be deleted and the device will no longer appear in Company Portal.  

If your device was only set up to access work or school email, your email account will be deleted. Unsaved emails will also be deleted.   

## Availability of factory reset option 

The factory reset option isn't available for all iOS devices. If you're an IT support person and want to find out more about these limitations, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](/intune/devices-wipe).  

## Factory reset device  
To reset a device to its original, out-of-box settings:   

1. Open the Company Portal app on any managed device and sign in with your work or school account.
2. Select **DEVICES**. 
3. Select the device you want to reset.
4. Next to **Rename**, select the ellipses button > **Factory reset**.  
5. Select **Reset** to start wiping the device.   


## Next steps  

* You can also [reset a device from the Company Portal website](reset-device-company-portal-website.md).  

* If you want to unenroll your device from Company Portal so that it's no longer managed by your organization, see [Remove iOS device from Intune](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-ios.md). Removing the device effectively removes it from Intune and may cause you to lose access to the work-related content on your device. 

* Need additional help? Contact your IT support person. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).
