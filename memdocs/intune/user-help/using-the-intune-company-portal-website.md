# Using the Intune Company Portal website
Use the Intune Company Portal website to remotely manage your work apps and enrolled personal devices. To access the Company Portal website, go to [https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) on any device (it doesn't have to be an enrolled device) and sign in with your work or school account.  

Once you're signed in, you can see your enrolled devices and:  

* [View and manage work apps](manage-apps-cpweb.md): Search and filter your available work apps, including required and already-installed apps. Check the compliance status for each of your devices.  

* [Remotely lock a device](remote-lock-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Lock a lost or stolen device so that no one else can access it.  

* [Rename a device](rename-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Change your personal device's generic or default model name so that you can quickly identify in Company Portal.  

* [Remove a device](remove-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Remove and unenroll a personal device that's no longer needed for work.  

* [Reset a device password](reset-your-passcode-cpwebsite.md): Reset a forgotten password.  

* [Reset device to factory settings](reset-device-company-portal-website.md): Restore a used, lost, or stolen personal device to its out-of-box state.  

* [Store recovery key](store-recovery-key.md): Store and rotate the FileVault key for an encrypted macOS device.   

* [Get recovery key](get-recovery-key-cpweb.md): Retrieve the stored FileVault key so that you can get back into your locked macOS device.   

Some actions aren't available on all operating systems and device types. The reset device password action, for example, won't work on an Android device that has a work profile.
