# Using the Intune Company Portal website
Use the [Intune Company Portal website] to remotely manage your work apps and enrolled personal devices. 

To access the Company Portal website, go to [https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980) and, just like you do in the Company Portal app, sign in with your work or school account. Once you're signed in, you can: 

* [View and manage work apps](manage-apps-cpweb.md): Search and filter your available work apps, including required and already-installed apps. Check the compliance status for each of your devices. *Availabed for devices running Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows 10/11.*  
* [Remotely lock a device](remote-lock-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Lock a lost or stolen device so that no one else can access it. *Available for devices running Android, iOS, or macOS.*   
* [Rename a device](rename-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Change your personal device's generic or default model name so that you can quickly identify in Company Portal. *Available for devices running Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows 10/11*.  
* [Remove a device](remove-your-device-cpwebsite.md): Remove and unenroll a personal device that's no longer needed for work. *Available for devices running Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows 10/11*.  
* [Reset a device password](reset-your-passcode-cpwebsite.md): Reset a forgotten password. *Available for devices running Android 7.0 and earlier, iOS (non-supervised devices), and Windows 10/11.*   
* [Reset device to factory settings](reset-device-company-portal-website.md): Restore a used, lost, or stolen personal device to its out-of-box state. *Available for Android, iOS, and Windows 10/11.*   
* [Store recovery key](store-recovery-key.md): Store and rotate the FileVault key for an encrypted macOS device.  
* [Get recovery key](get-recovery-key-cpweb.md): Retrieve the stored FileVault key so that you can get back into your locked macOS device.  

Some actions aren't available on all operating systems and device types. The reset device password action, for example, won't work on an Android device that has a work profile.
