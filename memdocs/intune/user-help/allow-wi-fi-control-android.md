# Allow Company Portal to control Wi-Fi  

Company Portal must get user permission to control Wi-Fi on certain devices. Company Portal needs this permission in order to receive Wi-Fi network configurations from Intune. If you don't allow Company Portal to control your Wi-Fi, Intune won't be able to deliver Wi-Fi configurations to your device, which could prevent you from connecting to your organization's Wi-Fi network.   

You'll be prompted to allow Wi-Fi control if you're on a device that's:

* Running Android version 10 or later and 
* Enrolling or already enrolled in Intune using Android device administrator

Company Portal prompts for permission during enrollment. If you enrolled your device in Intune before October 2020, you'll receive the prompt the next time your organization updates their Wi-Fi policy.
