# Automatically enroll Macs with Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager  

Set up automated device enrollment in Intune for Mac devices purchased through [Apple Business Manager](https://business.apple.com/) or [Apple School Manager](https://school.apple.com/). This enrollment method lets you enroll a large number of devices without needing to touch them or manually transfer them into Microsoft Intune. After you prepare devices in Intune and your chosen Apple portal, you can ship them directly to employees or students. Setup Assistant and enrollment automatically begins when the device turns on.  

This article describes how to set up and assign an Apple enrollment profile for corporate-owned Mac devices.   

Neither Apple Business Manager enrollment or Apple School Manager work with the [device enrollment manager](device-enrollment-manager-enroll.md).

<!--
**Steps to enable enrollment programs from Apple**

4. [Assign DEP profile to devices](#assign-an-enrollment-profile-to-devices)
5. [Distribute devices to users](#end-user-experience-with-managed-devices)
-->

## Prerequisites

- Devices purchased in [Apple School Manager](https://school.apple.com/) or [Apple's Automated Device Enrollment](http://deploy.apple.com)
- A list of serial numbers or a purchase order number.
- [MDM Authority](../fundamentals/mdm-authority-set.md)
- [Apple MDM Push certificate](../enrollment/apple-mdm-push-certificate-get.md)

## Get an Apple ADE token

Before you can enroll macOS devices with ADE or Apple School Manager, you need a token (.p7m) file from Apple. This token lets Intune sync information about the devices that your organization owns. It also lets Intune upload enrollment profiles to Apple and assign these profiles to devices.

You use the Apple portal to create a token. You also use the Apple portal to assign devices to Intune for management.

### Step 1. Download the Intune public key certificate required to create the token

1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Devices** > **macOS** > **macOS enrollment**. 
2. Select **Enrollment program tokens**. 
3. Select **Add**.  
4. Select **I agree** to grant permission to Microsoft to send user and device information to Apple. 
3. Select **Download your public key** and save it locally. The PEM file (.pem) is an encryption key used to request a trust-relationship certificate from Apple Business Manager.    

### Step 2. Use your key to download a token from Apple  

1. Select the Apple portal used by your organization. Your options: 
    * **Create a token via Apple Business Manager** 
    * **Create a token via Apple School Manager**  
2. Sign in to Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager with your company Apple ID. You can use this Apple ID to renew your token.
3. Select your account name, and then go to **Preferences**. 
4. Go to your MDM server assignments.  
5. Select the option to add an MDM server.  
6. Name the MDM server. The name is for identification purposes only while in Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager, and doesn't have to be the actual name or URL of the Microsoft Intune server. 
7. Upload your public key file and then save your changes. 
8. Download the server token.  

### Best practices  

While you're in Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager, apply device filters and assign devices to the MDM server.   

   * Apply filters: To filter devices before assigning them to your MDM server, go to **Devices** > **Filter**. You can filter devices by:  

        * Device management    
        * Source  
        * Order number 
        * Device type  
        * Storage size  

   * Bulk assign devices: Assign all eligible devices to an MDM server at the same time.     
        1. Go to your devices and select the ones you want to assign.  
        2. Select **Edit MDM Server**.  
        3. Select the MDM server you want to use and then continue to the next step. 
        5. When prompted to, confirm your changes. A notification appears to confirm that the devices have been assigned to the new MDM server.  

Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager keep track of your activity and changes. Go to your activity area in the portal to view assignment results and download logs.   

### Step 3. Save the Apple ID used to create this token

Return to the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and enter your Apple ID so that you have record of it in the future.   

![Screenshot highlighting the Apple ID field in the "Add enrollment program token" pane. ](./media/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios/image03.png)  

### Step 4. Upload your token

Under **Apple token**, browse to the certificate (PEM file). Choose **Open**, and then choose **Create**. The push certificate enables Intune to enroll devices, and deploy policies to enrolled devices. Intune automatically connects with Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager to sync your enrollment program account.  

## Create an Apple enrollment profile

Now that you've installed your token, you can create an enrollment profile for devices. A device enrollment profile defines the settings applied to a group of devices during enrollment.

1. In the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), return to **macOS Enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens**.  
2. Select a token.
3. Select **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS**.  

    ![Create a profile screenshot.](./media/device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos/image04.png)

4. On the **Basics** page, enter a name and description for the profile for administrative purposes. Users do not see these details. 

   >[!TIP]
   > You can use the name field to create a dynamic group in Azure Active Directory, and assign devices to the enrollment profile automatically. Use the profile name to define the *enrollmentProfileName* parameter. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory dynamic groups](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership#rules-for-devices).  

4. For **Platform**, select **macOS**.  

5. Select **Next**. 

5. On the **Management Settings** page, configure **User Affinity**.  Your options: 

    * Option 1 - **Enroll with User Affinity**: Enroll devices that are associated with an assigned user. Choose this option for work devices that belong to users, and if you want to require users to have the Company Portal app to install apps. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is available with this option.   

      This option requires users to authenticate before enrollment. Select one of the following authentication methods:   

      - **Setup Assistant with modern authentication**: This method requires users to complete all Setup Assistant screens and sign in to the Company Portal app with their Azure AD credentials before they can access resources.  After they sign in to Company Portal, the device:   

        - Registers with Azure AD.  
        - Becomes visible in the userâ€™s device list in Azure AD.  
        - Gains access to resources protected by conditional access.
        - Can be evaluated for device compliance.

        If the user doesn't sign in to the Company Portal to complete registration, they'll be redirected to the Company Portal app each time they try to open a managed app that's protected by conditional access.  

        Devices running macOS 10.15 and later can use this method. Older macOS devices will fall back to using the legacy Setup Assistant method.  

        For more information about how to get the Company Portal app to Mac users, see [Add the Company Portal for macOS app](../apps/apps-company-portal-macos.md).    

      - **Setup Assistant (legacy)**: Use the legacy Setup Assistant if you want users to experience the typical, out-of-box-experience for Apple products. This method installs standard preconfigured settings when the device enrolls with Intune management. If you're using Active Directory Federation Services and you're using Setup Assistant to authenticate, a [WS-Trust 1.3 Username/Mixed endpoint](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ff608241(v=ws.10)) is required. For more information about retrieving the ADFS endpoint, see [Get-ADfsEndpoint] (/powershell/module/adfs/get-adfsendpoint?view=win10-ps&preserve-view=true).

    * Option 2 - **Enroll without User Affinity**:  Enroll devices that aren't associated with a single user. Use this for shared devices and devices that don't need to access local user data. The Company Portal app doesn't work on these types of devices.   

8. **Locked enrollment** prevents users from unenrolling their devices from Intune. Select **Yes** to disable the Mac settings in System Preferences and Terminal that allow users to remove the management profile. After device enrollment, you cannot change this setting without wiping the device.  

9. Select **Next**.   

10. On the **Setup Assistant** page, configure the Setup Assistant experience.      
    1. Enter your department information so that users know who to contact for support:  
        * **Department Name**: This name appears when device users select **About Configuration** during activation.  
        * **Department Phone**: This phone number appears when device users select **Need Help** during activation.   
    2. Select the Setup Assistant screens you want to show or hide during device setup. Your options:  
        * **Hide**: The screen doesn't appear to users during device setup. After device setup, the user can go to their device settings to set up the feature.  
        * **Show**: The screen appears to users during device setup. The user can still skip screens that don't require immediate action. After device setup, the user can go to their device settings to set up the feature.  
        
          For a description of all Setup Assistant screens you can configure, see [Setup Assistant screens](#setup-assistant-screens) in this article. 

11. Select **Next**.

12. Select **Create** to finish creating the profile.

## Sync managed devices

Now that Intune has permission to manage your devices, you can sync Intune with Apple, and see your managed devices in the admin center.  

1. Return to **Enrollment program tokens** and choose your enrollment program token. 

2. Select **Devices** > **Sync**.  

   ![Screenshot of Enrollment program token area in the admin center, highlighting the example token, "Devices" link, and "Sync" button.](./media/device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos/image06.png)  

### Sync restrictions  
To comply with Apple's terms for acceptable enrollment program traffic, Microsoft Intune imposes the following restrictions:  
 - A full sync can run no more than once every seven days. During a full sync, Intune fetches the complete updated list of serial numbers assigned to the Apple MDM server connected to Intune. If you delete a device from Intune without unassigning it from the Apple MDM server in Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager, it won't be re-imported into Intune until the full sync is run. 
 - If a device is released from ABM/ASM, it can take up to 45 days for it to be automatically deleted from the devices page in Intune. You can manually delete released devices from Intune one by one if needed. Released devices will be accurately reported as being Removed from ABM/ASM in Intune until they are automatically deleted within 30-45 days.
 - A sync is run automatically every 24 hours. You can also sync by clicking the **Sync** button (no more than once every 15 minutes). All sync requests are given 15 minutes to finish. The **Sync** button is disabled until a sync is completed. This sync will refresh existing device status and import new devices assigned to the Apple MDM server.

## Assign an enrollment profile to devices

You must assign an enrollment program profile to devices before they can enroll.

1. Return to **Enrollment program tokens** and select a token.  
2. Select **Devices**. 
3. Choose your devices from the list, and then select **Assign profile**.  
3. Choose a profile to assign, and then select **Assign**.  

### Assign a default profile

You can assign a default macOS profile to all devices enrolling with a specific token.  

1. Return to **Enrollment program tokens** and select a token.  
2. Select **Set Default Profile**.
3. Choose a profile, and then select **Save**.  

## Distribute devices

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Devices with user affinity require that each user be assigned an Intune license. Devices without user affinity require a device license.  

Distribute prepared devices throughout your organization. Devices registered with Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager and assigned a profile in Intune can be enrolled:  

- During Setup Assistant for new devices or wiped devices.
- After Setup Assistant using the profiles command.  

### Enroll Macs during Setup Assistant   

Macs configured in Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager will automatically enroll in Microsoft Intune during Setup Assistant with a Remote Management prompt.  

> [!NOTE]
> If the device was assigned to a macOS enrollment profile with user affinity, the device user must sign in to the Company Portal to complete Azure AD registration and conditional access requirements.  

### Enroll Macs after Setup Assistant  

Use these steps to enroll corporate-owned Macs running macOS 10.13 and later in Intune after Setup Assistant completes.  

1. In the Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager portal, import the device.
2. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), make sure that the device is assigned a macOS enrollment profile with or without user affinity.
3. Log in to the device as a local administrator account.  
4. To trigger enrollment, on the **Home** page, open **Terminal** and run the following command:
    sudo profiles renew -type enrollment  
5. Enter your device password for the local administrator account.  
6. In the **Device enrollment** window, choose **Details**.
