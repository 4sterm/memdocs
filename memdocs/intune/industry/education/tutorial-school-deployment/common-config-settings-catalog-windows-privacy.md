# Windows Privacy

Settings described in this article should only be deployed after careful consideration as they're affecting usersâ€™ privacy.

[!NOTE]

#### Additional information:

- [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS devices](/mem/intune/configuration/settings-catalog)

## Settings Catalog Policies

| **Settings Catalog** | **Value** | **Notes** | **CSP** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Allow Location** | Force Location On. All Location Privacy settings are toggled on and grayed out. Users can't change the settings and all consent permissions will be automatically suppressed. | Required to invoke **Locate device** action on Windows devices in Intune. | [System/AllowLocation](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-system#allowlocation) |
| **Let Apps Access Location** | Force allow. | Windows apps are allowed to access location. You can specify either a default setting for all apps or a per-app setting by specifying a Package Family Name. You can get the Package Family Name for an app by using the Get-AppPackage Windows PowerShell cmdlet. A per-app setting overrides the default setting. | [Privacy/LetAppsAccessLocation](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-privacy#letappsaccesslocation) |
