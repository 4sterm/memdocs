## Settings Catalog Policies

  | **Settings Catalog** | **Value** | **Notes** | **CSP** |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **Let Apps Access Location** | Force allow. | Windows apps are allowed to access location. You can specify either a default setting for all apps or a per-app setting by specifying a Package Family Name. You can get the Package Family Name for an app by using the Get-AppPackage Windows PowerShell cmdlet. A per-app setting overrides the default setting. | [LetAppsAccessLocation](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-privacy#LetAppsAccessLocation) |
