# Plan grouping and targeting

âœ… Organize devices and users

By organizing devices, students, classrooms, or learning curricula into groups, you can provide students with the resources and configurations they need.

Intune has three main targeting methods:

- **Virtual groups** are created by Intune and allow you to target *All devices* and *All users*.

- **Groups** are created and managed in Entra and can contain users or devices.
  - **Assigned groups** are used when you want to manually add users or devices to a group.

  - **Dynamic groups** reference rules that you create to assign students or devices to groups, which automate the membership's maintenance of those groups.

- [**Filters**](/mem/intune/fundamentals/filters) allows you to narrow the assignment scope of a policy. <br><br>For example, use filters to target devices with a specific OS version or a specific manufacturer, target only personal devices or only organization-owned devices, and more. Filters are evaluated dynamically during a device check-in and can therefore sometimes offer a faster dynamic grouping option than an Entra dynamic group.

> [!NOTE]
> Filters are not accessible in Intune for Education.

Two extra groups are precreated if you use **Microsoft School Data Sync (SDS)**: *All teachers* and *All students*. SDS can also be configured to automatically create and maintain groups of students and teachers for each school.

Beyond the defaults, groups can be customized to suit various needs. For example, if you have both *Windows 10* and *Windows 11* devices in your school, you can create groups, such as *Windows 10 devices* and *Windows 11 devices*, to assign different policies and applications to.

> [!TIP]
> For more information on grouping and targeting options, see [Performance recommendations for Grouping, Targeting, and Filtering in large Microsoft Intune environments](/mem/intune/fundamentals/filters-performance-recommendations).

## Examples

The way you target configuration and apps may depend on many factors and the enrollment type. This section includes targeting methods commonly seen amongst Education organizations.

::: zone pivot="windows"

### Autopilot
When devices are imported into Autopilot they include the manufacturer and model of the device. A group tag can also be added to each device imported. The group tag can be used to create groups for targeting. Some customers use this to create groups for different autopilot profiles, to target different apps or profiles and also for assigning scope tags for role-based access control.
These are the common groups used for devices that are enrolled using Autopilot.

- All devices
- All Autopilot devices (based on ZTDID)
- All *use case* devices (based on group tag)
- All *location use case* devices (based on group tag)

Here are examples of queries commonly used for dynamic security groups.

| Name | Type | Query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All Windows devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.deviceOSType -startsWith \"Windows\") |
| All Autopilot devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any _ -startsWith \"[ZTDId]\") |
| All non-Autopilot devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.deviceOSType -startsWith \"Windows\") -and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \"Company\") -and -not(device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -startsWith \"[ZTDId]\")) |
| All *use case* devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq \"[OrderID]:*use case*\")) |

### Provisioning packages
These are the common groups used for devices that are enrolled using provisioning packages.

- All devices
- All *use case* devices (based on device name set in the provisioning package)

| Name | Type | Query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All Windows devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.deviceOSType -startsWith \"Windows\") |
| All *use case* devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.displayName -startsWith \"*use case*\") |

### All enrollment types
Filters can be used to further include or exclude devices from groups. For example:

- Devices running Windows 10 (osVersion *starts with* 10.0.1)
- Devices running Windows 11 (osVersion *starts with* 10.0.2)

On Windows apps and policies can also be targeted at user groups. Many apps and policies on Windows are "device" targeted, so even if targeted at a user group, will apply to all subsequent users of that device.

### Automated Device Enrollment
When devices are enrolled with Automated Device Enrollment, the devices are stamped with the enrollment profile name used during enrollment. Devices can be associated with different enrollment profiles in the Automated Device Enrollment token section under enrollment. Some customers use this to create groups or filters for different enrollment settings, to target different apps or profiles and also for assigning scope tags for role-based access control.

These are the common groups used for devices that are enrolled using Automated Device Enrollment.

- All devices
- All *'use case'* devices (based on enrollmentProfileName)

Here are examples of queries commonly used for dynamic security groups.

| Name | Type | Query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All iOS devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.deviceOSType -startsWith \"iOS\") |
| All *'use case'* devices | Dynamic membership rules | (device.enrollmentProfileName -eq \"'*use case*'\") |

To apply settings as quickly as possible during enrollment without waiting for dynamic group updates, some customers use a filter based on enrollmentProfileName and target configuration at the *All Devices* virutal group.

- Devices with a specific enrollmentProfileName (enrollmentProfileName *equals* *'use case*')

## Tips

::: zone pivot="windows"

For Windows devices:
- Applications and policies targeted to a *device dynamic group* based on [an Autopilot *Group Tag*](/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot) will be applied to the devices as soon as they are enrolled in Intune, before users signs in.
  This can be useful in bulk enrollment scenarios, where devices are enrolled without requiring users to sign in. Devices can be configured and prepared in advance, before distribution.

- Applications and policies targeted to a *device dynamic group* based on other attributes will be applied to the devices after they are enrolled in Intune, after users gain access to the device.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="ios"

For iOS devices:
- If you target applications and policies to a *device dynamic group*, they will be applied to the devices after they are enrolled in Intune, after users gain access to the device.
