# Microsoft Edge

A list of Microsoft Edge policies commonly used in education to provide a clean and seamless experience for staff and students.

Microsoft Edge supports mandatory and recommended policies. Mandatory policies override user preferences and prevent the user from the policy. Recommended policies provide a default setting that the user can override. Most policies are only mandatory but there's a subset that is mandatory and recommended. If both versions of a policy are set, the mandatory setting takes precedence. A recommended policy only takes effect when the user hasn't modified the setting.

> [!NOTE]
 >Microsoft Intune Settings Catalog categories:
>- Mandatory policies category: **Microsoft Edge**
>- Recommended policies category: **Microsoft Edge â€“ Default Settings (users can override)**
