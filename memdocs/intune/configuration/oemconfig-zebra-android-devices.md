# Deploy OEMConfig profiles to Zebra devices in Microsoft Intune

In Microsoft Intune, use OEMConfig to customize OEM-specific settings for Android Enterprise devices. These settings are specific to the device manufacturer, and deployed using configuration profiles in Intune.

On Zebra devices, you can deploy or assign profiles to the same device(depending on which OEMCOnfig app is being used, details in the later section). Existing OEMConfig profiles can use this feature the next time the devices sync with Intune.

This feature applies to:

- Zebra devices running Android Enterprise

To learn more about OEMConfig, including what it does, and how to use it, go to [OEMConfig configuration profile](android-oem-configuration-overview.md).

This article describes deploying OEMConfig multiple profiles to Zebra devices, describes ordering, and using the reporting features in Microsoft Intune.

## Prerequisites

Create an [OEMConfig configuration profile](android-oem-configuration-overview.md).

## OEMConfig App for Zebra devices

There are now two versions of Zebra OEMConfig App available for managing Zebra android devices. Make sure to use correct version for the devices being targeted:

## Deploying profiles to the Zebra device

Historically Zebra has allowed multiple profiles to be deployed on each device through its **Legacy Zebra OEMConfig App**. This feature allowed you to split your Zebra OEMConfig settings into smaller profiles. For example, create a baseline profile that affects all devices. Then, create more profiles that configure settings specific to a device. This is possible on all the android devices having Android 11 and earlier.
With the introduction of the new **Zebra OEMConfig Powered by MX**, multiple profiles are no longer allowed. This new app aligns closely with Googleâ€™s standards and only a single profile is deployed on the device. Admins must ensure to create and deploy only one profile with all the required setting configurations. If an attempt is made to deploy multiple profiles, the profile goes into conflict and no setting is configured. Note: New Zebra OEMConfg app runs on Android version 11 and above.

## Multiple profiles using Legacy App
Zebra's OEMConfig schema also uses **Actions**. Actions are operations that run on the device. They don't configure any settings. Use these actions to trigger a file download, clear the clipboard, and more. For a full list of the supported actions, go to [Zebra's documentation](https://techdocs.zebra.com/oemconfig/) (opens Zebra's web site).

For example, you create a Zebra OEMConfig profile that applies some settings to the device. Another Zebra OEMConfig profile includes an action that clears the clipboard. You assign the first profile to a Zebra devices group. Later, you need to clear the clipboard on those devices. You assign the second profile to the same devices group, without changing the first profile. The device clipboard gets cleared without resending or affecting the configuration settings created in the first profile.

In another example, you assigned an OEMConfig profile that configured some Zebra device settings. Recently, users are reporting issues with a specific application, and you want to clear the app's cache. Create a new OEMConfig profile that includes only the "clear cache" action. Assign the profile to the devices that need it.

Multiple profiles take longer to deploy than a single profile. If the speed of delivery of policy to the device is important, you should group settings into the smallest number of profiles possible. 

## Ordering

With multiple profiles on each device, the order that profiles are deployed isn't guaranteed. This behavior is a Google Play limitation. To run operations in sequence, you can use [Zebra's Transaction Step feature](https://techdocs.zebra.com/oemconfig/11-4/mc/#transactionsteps) (opens Zebra's web site). 

To summarize, if order matters, use [Zebra's Transaction Step feature](https://techdocs.zebra.com/oemconfig/11-4/mc/#transactionsteps) (opens Zebra's web site). If order doesn't matter, use multiple Intune profiles. 

Let's look at some examples:

- You want to turn on Bluetooth for all newly enrolled Zebra devices before configuring any other setting on these devices. To run operations in sequence, use the **Steps** feature in Zebra's schema.

  Create one Intune profile that has two Transaction Steps. The first step includes Bluetooth settings, and the second step configures the other setting. When Zebra's OEMConfig app receives the profile, it runs the steps in order.

  For more information, go to [Zebra's transaction steps](https://techdocs.zebra.com/oemconfig/11-4/mc/#transactionsteps) (opens Zebra's web site).

- You want all Zebra devices to display time in 24-hour format. For some of these devices, you want to turn off the camera. The time and camera settings don't depend on each other.

  Create two Intune profiles:

  - **Profile 1**: Displays the time in 24-hour format. On Monday, this profile is assigned to the **All Zebra AE devices** group.
  - **Profile 2**: Turns off the camera. On Tuesday, this profile is assigned to the **Zebra AE factory devices** group.

  On Wednesday, you enroll 10 new Zebra devices with Intune. Profile 1 and Profile 2 are assigned. After the new devices sync with Intune, they receive the profiles. The devices may get Profile 2 before getting Profile 1.

## Enhanced reporting

You deploy a profile, and it's executed by the Zebra OEMConfig app on the device. The Zebra OEMConfig app reports the profile status to Intune. In the Intune admin center, you can see the status of deployed OEMConfig profiles, and any errors or warnings.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select your Zebra OEMConfig profile > **Monitor** > **Device status**. This option shows the devices that have your OEMConfig profile assigned.
3. Select a device > **Device configuration** > Select your Zebra OEMConfig profile. This option shows the profile settings that succeeded or failed.

    Select a failed row. Details are shown that have more information on why it failed.
