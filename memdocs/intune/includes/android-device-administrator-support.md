> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Intune is ending support for Android device administrator management on August 30, 2024. After that date, we do not guarantee functionality, will not provide support, and will not implement bug or security fixes. If you currently use device administrator management, we recommend switching to another Android management option in Intune before support ends. For more information, see [Plan for change: Ending  support for Android device administrator](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#notices).
