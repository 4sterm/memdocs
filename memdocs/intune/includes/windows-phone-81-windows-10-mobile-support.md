<!-- 9.8.2022 - mandia: New text added so this include file applies to Windows 8.1-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On October 22, 2022, Microsoft Intune is ending support for devices running Windows 8.1. After that date, technical assistance and automatic updates on these devices won't be available. For more information, go to [Plan for Change: Ending support for Windows 8.1](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#plan-for-change-ending-support-for-windows-81-).
>
> If you currently use Windows 8.1, then we recommend moving to Windows 10/11 devices. Microsoft Intune has built-in security and device features that manage Windows 10/11 client devices. For more information, go to [End of support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/end-of-support).

<!-- 9.8.2022 - mandia: The following was the original text of this include file. Replaced this text since Win10 Mobile and Windows Phone support ended in 2019.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Windows 10 Mobile](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4485197/windows-10-mobile-end-of-support-faq) and [Windows Phone 8.1](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4036480/windows-phone-8-1-end-of-support-faq) support has ended. Windows 10 Mobile and Windows Phone 8.1 enrollments will fail and related apps can no longer be added to Intune. These profile types are being removed from the Intune UI. Devices currently enrolled will stop syncing with the Intune service.
>
> Existing policies and profiles on these platforms are becoming read-only, and can't be changed. You can remove assignments, and then delete the policies and profiles.
> 
> If Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile are being used, we recommend moving to Windows 10 devices. Windows 10 has built-in security and device features that have a first class integration with Microsoft Intune.
