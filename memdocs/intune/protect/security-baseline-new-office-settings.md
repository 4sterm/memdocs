# Microsoft  365 Apps for Enterprise security baseline settings reference for Microsoft Intune

This article is a reference for the settings that are available in the Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise security baseline for Microsoft Intune and applies to versions of that baseline that released in May 2023 or later.


## About this reference article

Each security baseline is a group of preconfigured Windows settings that help you apply and enforce granular security settings that the relevant security teams recommend. You can also customize each baseline you deploy to enforce only those settings and values you require. When you create a security baseline profile in Intune, you're creating a template that consists of multiple device configuration profiles.

The details that are displayed in this article are based on baseline version that is selected at the top of the article. For each selection, this article displays:

- A list of each setting in that baseline version.
- The default configuration of each setting in that baseline version.
- When available, a link to the underlying configuration service provider (CSP) documentation, or other related content from the relevant product group that provides context and possibly additional details for the settings use.

When a new version of a baseline becomes available, it replaces the previous version. Profile instances that youâ€™ve created prior to the availability of a new version:

- Become read-only. You can continue to use those profiles but can't edit them to change their configuration.
- Can be updated to the latest version. After you update a profile to the current baseline version, you can edit the profile to modify settings.
