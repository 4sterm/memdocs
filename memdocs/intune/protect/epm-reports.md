Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) is a solution you can integrate with Microsoft Intune. EPM policies empower your organizations non-administrative users to run files that require elevated permissions, and does so with zero or limited disruptions to the users workflow. Through integration with Microsoft Intune, EPM can help you to secure your organization by removing administrative permissions for most users.

The information in this article discusses the reports for EPM, including device and policy views related to EPM policies. Details about the elevation of files is report back to Intune based on the devices reporting scope. Reporting scopes are configured as part of a [Windows elevation setting policy](../protect/epm-policies.md#windows-elevation-settings-policy) for EPM, and different devices can have different reporting scope configurations.

- Windows 10
