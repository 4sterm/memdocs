# Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management

When you use the Microsoft Tunnel VPN Gateway, you can extend Tunnel support by adding Tunnel for Mobile Application Management (MAM). Tunnel MAM extends the Microsoft Tunnel VPN gateway to support devices that run Android or iOS, and that aren't enrolled with Microsoft Intune. With this solution, your users can use a single device that hasn't enrolled with Intune to gain secure access to the organizations on-premises apps and resources using modern authentication, Single Sign On and conditional access. With Tunnel for MAM, your users can use their own device (BYOD) for both work and personal use, without having to grant the organizationâ€™s IT department control over that device.

Applies to:

- Android  (In public preview)
- iOS/iPadOS (In public preview)

> [!NOTE]
> While in public preview, Microsoft Tunnel for MAM is available at no additional cost. When Tunnel for MAM becomes generally available, it will be available as a [**premium add-on**](/fundamentals/premium-add-ons.md) and require an additional cost to the licensing options that include Microsoft Endpoint Manager or Intune.
