[!INCLUDE [intune-add-on-note](../includes/intune-add-on-note.md)]

Microsoft Intune Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) allows your organizationâ€™s users to run as a standard user (without administrator rights) and complete tasks that require elevated privileges. 

Tasks that commonly require administrative privileges are application installs (like Microsoft 365 Applications), updating device drivers, and running certain Windows diagnostics.

The information in this article can help you configure and manage use of support approval for elevation requests.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
