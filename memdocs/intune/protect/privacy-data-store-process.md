# Data storage and processing in Intune

### Storing customer data

After Intune [collects the data](privacy-data-collect.md), Intune follows the Data Handling Standard policy for Microsoft 365 that specifies how customer data is stored and processed. See [Where your Microsoft 365 customer data is stored](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations). Personal data is processed within the audited compliance boundary of the Intune service under the technical security measures assured through [Microsoft Online Services Terms (OST)](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=46).

### Storage locations

Microsoft offers and operates Intune services in many regions worldwide. Intune respects the storage location elections made by the administrator for Customer Data.

For more information, see [Data Center Locations](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations?view=o365-worldwide#data-center-locations)

### Personal data retention

Microsoft 365 Data Handling Standard policy specifies how long customer data is retained after deletion. There are two scenarios in which customer data is deleted:

-**Active Deletion**: The tenant has an active subscription and a user or administrator deletes data, or administrators delete a user.
-**Passive Deletion**: The tenant subscription ends.

For each of the deletion scenarios, see [Data Retention, Deletion, and Destruction in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview?view=o365-worldwide).  

In general, personal data collected by Intune is removed within 30 days after deletion. Audit logs are retained for up to one year for security purposes. 


## Processing personal data

Intune processes personal data with ISO certified systems. For more information, see the [Service Trust Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/stp).

### Profiling and marketing

Microsoft Intune does not use any personal data collected as part of providing the service for profiling or marketing purposes.
