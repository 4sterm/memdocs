# Microsoft Edge security baseline settings reference for Microsoft Intune 
This article is a reference for the settings that are available in the Microsoft Edge security baseline for Microsoft Intune and applies to versions of that baseline that released in May 2023 or later. 
If you use a security baseline for Edge version 85 or earlier, see the following article:
 - [List of the settings in the Microsoft Edge security baseline in Intune](../protect/security-baseline-settings-edge.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Beginning in May 2023, all new security baseline versions use a new settings format that replaces previous versions. While the last version instance for a baseline that uses the older setting format remains available to use, the older format will no longer receive updates for new settings, or updated default configurations.

## About this reference article

Each security baseline is a group of preconfigured Windows settings that help you apply and enforce granular security settings that the relevant security teams recommend. You can also customize each baseline you deploy to enforce only those settings and values you require. When you create a security baseline profile in Intune, you're creating a template that consists of multiple device configuration profiles.

The details that are displayed in this article are based on baseline version that is selected at the top of the article. For each selection, this article displays:

- A list of each setting in that baseline version. 
- The default configuration of each setting in that baseline version.
- When available, a link to the underlying configuration service provider (CSP) documentation, or other related content from the relevant product group that provides context and possibly additional details for the settings use.

When a new version of a baseline becomes available, it replaces the previous version. Profile instances that youâ€™ve created prior to the availability of a new version:

- Become read-only. You can continue to use those profiles but can't edit them to change their configuration.

  > [!TIP]  
  > Because the new baselines versions introduced in May 2023 or later exist side-by-side with the last baseline version from the older format, baselines for the last available version of that older format remain accessible to use and to edit.
- Can be updated to the latest version. After you update a profile to the current baseline version, you can edit the profile to modify settings.
