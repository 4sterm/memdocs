# Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile Application Management for iOS/iPadOS (public preview)

In public preview, you can use Microsoft Tunnel VPN Gateway with unenrolled iOS devices to support Mobile Application Management (MAM) scenarios. With support for MAM, your unenrolled devices can use Tunnel to securely connect to your organization allowing users and apps safe access to your organizational data.

Applies to:  
- iOS/iPadOS

> [!NOTE]
> While in public preview, Microsoft Tunnel for MAM is available at no additional cost. When Tunnel for MAM becomes generally available, it will be available as a [**premium add-on**](/fundamentals/premium-add-ons.md) and require an additional cost to the licensing options that include Microsoft Endpoint Manager or Intune.


To extend your existing [Microsoft Tunnel configuration](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md) to support [MAM](../fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-mamwe.md), youâ€™ll create and deploy three profiles that configure this support on your unenrolled devices:






## Nex steps

- [Configure Microsoft Tunnel](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-configure.md)
- [Monitor Microsoft Tunnel](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-monitor.md)
- [MAM Tunnel for Android](../protect/microsoft-tunnel-mam-android.md)
