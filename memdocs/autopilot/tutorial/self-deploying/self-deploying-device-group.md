# Self-deploying mode: Create a device group

Autopilot self-deploying mode steps:
- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](self-deploying-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Register devices as Autopilot devices](self-deploying-register-device.md)
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Step 3: Create a device group**
- Step 4: [Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](self-deploying-esp.md)
- Step 5: [Create and assign Autopilot profile](self-deploying-autopilot-profile.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode workflow, see [Windows Autopilot self-deploying overview](self-deploying-workflow.md)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you've already created device groups from another Autopilot scenario, you can skip this step and move on to [Step 4: Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](self-deploying-esp.md). However, be aware that if you're deploying multiple different Autopilot scenarios to different devices, separate device groups will be required for each Autopilot scenario.
