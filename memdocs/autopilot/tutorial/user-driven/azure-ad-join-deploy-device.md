# User-driven Azure AD join: Deploy the device

Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join steps:
- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](azure-ad-join-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Allow users to join devices to Azure AD](azure-ad-join-allow-users-to-join.md)
- Step 3: [Register devices as Autopilot devices](azure-ad-join-register-device.md)
- Step 4: [Create a device group](azure-ad-join-device-group.md)
- Step 5: [Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](azure-ad-join-esp.md)
- Step 6: [Create and assign Autopilot profile](azure-ad-join-autopilot-profile.md)
- Step 7: [Assign Autopilot device to a user (optional)](azure-ad-join-assign-device-to-user.md)

> - **Step 8: Deploy the device**

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join workflow, see [Windows Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join overview](azure-ad-join-workflow.md#workflow)

## Deploy the device

Once all of the configurations for the Windows Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join deployment have been completed on the Intune and Azure AD side, the next step is to start the Autopilot deployment process on the device. If desired, deploy any additional applications and policies that should run during the Autopilot deployment to the device group that the device is a member of.

[!INCLUDE [Assignment tip](../includes/assignment-tip.md)]

To start the Autopilot deployment process on the device, select a device that is part of the device group created in the previous [Create a device group](azure-ad-join-device-group.md) step, and then follow these steps:

[!INCLUDE [Network connectivity](../includes/network-connectivity.md)]

4. Once the Autopilot process begins, the Azure AD sign-in page appears. At the Azure AD sign-in page, if a user was assigned to the device, their username may be pre-populated in this screen. Enter the Azure AD credentials for the user and then select **Next** (Windows 10) or **Sign in** (Windows 11) to sign in. If necessary, proceed through the multi-factor authentication (MFA) screens.

5. After authenticating with Azure AD, the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) appears. The Enrollment Status Page (ESP) displays progress during the provisioning process across three phases:

   - **Device preparation** (Device ESP)
   - **Device setup** (Device ESP)
   - **Account setup** (User ESP)

    The first two phases of **Device preparation** and **Device setup** are part of the Device ESP while the final phase of **Account setup** is part of the User ESP.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > To view and hide detailed progress information in the ESP during the provisioning process:
    >
    > - Windows 10: To show details, next to the appropriate phase select **Show details**. To hide the details, next to the appropriate phase select **Hide details**.
    > - Windows 11: To show details, next to the appropriate phase select **∨**. To hide the details, next to the appropriate phase select **∧**.

6. Once **Account setup** and the user ESP process completes, the provisioning process completes, the ESP finishes, and the Desktop appears. At this point, the end-user can start using the device.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Depending on how the Autopilot profile was configured at the [Create and assign Autopilot profile](azure-ad-join-autopilot-profile.md) step, additional screens may during the Autopilot deployment appear such as:
>
> - Language/Region, Keyboard, and License Terms screens before the Azure AD sign-in page.
> - Privacy screen when the User ESP/Account setup begins but before the user is automatically signed in.
