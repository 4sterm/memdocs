# User-driven Azure AD join: Create and assign user-driven Azure AD join Autopilot profile

Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join steps:
- Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](azure-ad-join-automatic-enrollment.md)
- Step 2: [Allow users to join devices to Azure AD](azure-ad-join-allow-users-to-join.md)
- Step 3: [Register devices as Autopilot devices](azure-ad-join-register-device.md)
- Step 4: [Create a device group](azure-ad-join-device-group.md)
- Step 5: [Configure and assign Autopilot Enrollment Status Page (ESP)](azure-ad-join-esp.md)
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - **Step 6: Create and assign Autopilot profile**
- Step 7: [Assign Autopilot device to a user (optional)](azure-ad-join-assign-device-to-user.md)

For an overview of the Windows Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join workflow, see [Windows Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join overview](azure-ad-join-workflow.md)

## Create and assign user-driven Azure AD join Autopilot profile

While the ESP controls what is shown during device and user setup and specifies how soon a user can use their device, the Autopilot profile specifies how the device is configured during Windows Setup, or during OOBE.

When an admin creates an Autopilot profile for the user-driven scenario, devices with this Autopilot profile are associated with the user enrolling the device. User credentials are required to enroll the device.

The difference between an Autopilot user-driven Azure AD join and an Autopilot hybrid Azure AD join is that the user-driven Azure AD join scenario only joins Azure AD during Autopilot. The hybrid Azure AD join scenario joins both an on-premises domain and Azure AD during Autopilot.

> [!TIP]
>
> For Configuration Manager admins, the Autopilot profile is similar to some of the configuration that takes place during a task sequence via an unattend.xml file. The unattend.xml file is configured during the **Apply Windows Settings** and **Apply Network Settings** steps. Note however that Autopilot does not use unattend.xml files.

To create a user-driven Azure AD join Autopilot profile, follow these steps:

[!INCLUDE [Autopilot profiles before steps](../includes/autopilot-profile-steps-before.md)]

8. In the **Out-of-box experience (OOBE)** page:

      - For **Deployment mode**, select **User-driven**.

      - For **Join to Azure AD as**, select **Azure AD joined**.

      - For **Microsoft Software License Terms**, select **Hide** to skip the EULA page.

      - For **Privacy settings**, select **Hide** to skip the privacy settings.

      - For **Hide change account options**, select **Hide**.

      - For **User account type**, select the desired account type for the user (**Administrator** or **Standard** user). If **Administrator** is chosen, the user is added to the local Admin group.

      - For **Allow pre-provisioned deployment**, select **No**.

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > For the Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment Azure AD join scenario, see [Step by step tutorial for Windows Autopilot for pre-provisioned deployment Azure AD join in Intune](../pre-provisioning/azure-ad-join-workflow.md)
        
      - For **Language (Region)**, select **Operating system default** to use the default language for the operating system being configured. If another language is desired, select the desired language from the drop-down list.

      - For **Automatically configure keyboard**, select **Yes** to skip the keyboard selection page.

      - For **Apply device name template**, select **No**. Alternatively, **Yes** can be chosen to apply a device name template. Be aware of the following if the name template is selected to **Yes**:

        - Names must be 15 characters or less, and can have letters, numbers, and hyphens.
        - Names can't be all numbers.
        - Use the [%SERIAL% macro](/windows/client-management/mdm/accounts-csp) to add a hardware-specific serial number.
        - Use the [%RAND:x% macro](/windows/client-management/mdm/accounts-csp) to add a random string of numbers, where x equals the number of digits to add.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > The above settings have been selected to minimize needed user interaction during device setup. However, some of the settings that are hidden can instead be shown as desired. For example, some regions may require that **Privacy settings** always be shown.
      >
      > Also note that if language and keyboard settings are shown instead of hidden, they require ethernet connectivity. Wi-fi connectivity isn't supported because of the requirement to choose a language, locale, and keyboard to initiate the Wi-fi connection.

## Verify device has an Autopilot profile assigned to it

[!INCLUDE [How to verify a device has an Autopilot profile assigned to it in Intune](../includes/verify-autopilot-profile-assignment.md)]

## Next step: Assign Autopilot device to a user (optional)

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Step 7: Assign Autopilot device to a user (optional)](azure-ad-join-assign-device-to-user.md)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you don't plan to assign a user to the device, at this point, the device is ready to be deployed. If desired, deploy any additional applications, policies, and profiles that should run during Autopilot to the device group that the device is a member of. Boot the device with a fresh install of Windows and the Autopilot deployment should begin.
