# Windows Autopilot registration overview

**Applies to:**

- Windows 11
- Windows 10
- Windows Holographic, version 2004

Before a device is deployed using Windows Autopilot, the device must be registered with the Windows Autopilot deployment service.

Successful registration requires that two processes are complete:

1. The device's unique [hardware identity](#device-identification) (known as a hardware hash) is captured and uploaded to the Autopilot service.
1. The device is associated to an Azure tenant ID.

Ideally, the OEM, reseller, or distributor performs both of these processes from which the devices were purchased. An OEM or other device provider uses the [registration authorization](registration-auth.md) process to perform device registration on your behalf.

Registration can also be performed within your organization by collecting the hardware identity from new or existing devices and [uploading it manually](manual-registration.md). If devices meet certain requirements, they can also be configured for [automatic registration](automatic-registration.md) with Windows Autopilot. For more information about the ways in which devices can be registered with Windows Autopilot, see the following overview articles:

- [OEM registration](oem-registration.md)
- [Reseller, distributor, or partner registration](partner-registration.md)
- [Automatic registration](automatic-registration.md)
- [Manual registration](manual-registration.md)

When you register an Autopilot device, it automatically creates an Azure AD object. The Autopilot deployment process needs this object to identify the device before the user signs in. If you delete this object, the device can fail to enroll through Autopilot.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't register to Autopilot the following types of devices:
>
> - [Azure AD registered](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-register), also known as "workplace joined"
> - [Intune MDM-only enrollment](/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-methods#user-self-enrollment-in-intune)
>
> These options are intended for users to join personally-owned devices to their organization's network.

Once a device is registered in Autopilot if a profile isn't assigned, it receives the default Autopilot profile. If you don't want a device to go through Autopilot, you must remove the Autopilot registration.

## Terms

The following terms are used to refer to various steps in the registration process:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| device registration | Device registration happens when a device's hardware hash is associated with the Windows Autopilot service. This process can be automated for new enterprise devices manufactured by OEMs that are Windows Autopilot partners. |
| add devices | Adding a device is the process of registering a device with the Windows Autopilot service (if it isn't already registered) **and associating it to a tenant ID**. |
| import devices | Importing devices is the process of uploading a comma-separated-values (CSV) file that contains device information such as the model and serial number in order to manually add devices. |
| enroll devices | Enrolling a device is the process of adding devices to Intune. |

## Device identification

To identify a device with Windows Autopilot, the device's unique hardware hash must be captured and uploaded to the service. As previously mentioned, this step is ideally done by the hardware vendor (OEM, reseller, or distributor) automatically associating the device with an organization. It's also possible to do identify a device with a [harvesting process](add-devices.md) that collects the device's hardware hash from within a running Windows installation.

The hardware hash contains details about the device, such as:

- manufacturer
- model
- device serial number
- hard drive serial number
- details about when the ID was generated
- many other attributes that can be used to uniquely identify the device

The hardware hash changes each time it's generated because it includes details about when it was generated. When the Windows Autopilot deployment service attempts to match a device, it considers changes like that. It also considers large changes such as a new hard drive, and is still able to match successfully. But large changes to the hardware, such as a motherboard replacement, wouldn't match, so a new hash would need to be generated and uploaded.

For more information about device IDs, see the following articles:

- [Windows Autopilot device guidelines](autopilot-device-guidelines.md)
- [Add devices to a customer account](/partner-center/autopilot)

## Windows Autopilot devices

Devices that have been registered with the Windows Autopilot service are displayed in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) under **Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Windows enrollment** > **Windows Autopilot Deployment Program** > **Devices**:

> [!NOTE]
> Devices that are listed in Intune under **Devices** > **Windows** > **Windows devices** are not the same as Windows Autopilot devices (**Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Windows enrollment** > **Windows Autopilot Deployment Program** > **Devices**). Windows Autopilot devices are added to the list of **Windows devices** when both of the following are complete:

> - The Autopilot registration process is successful.
> - A [licensed](licensing-requirements.md) user has signed in on the device.

## Deregister a device

Whenever a device permanently leaves an organization, whether it's for a repair or the end of the device life cycle, the device should always be deregistered from Autopilot.

Below we describe the steps an admin would go through to deregister a device from Intune and Autopilot.

### Deregister from Intune

To deregister an Autopilot device from Intune:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. In the **Home** screen, select **Devices** in the left pane.

3. In the **Devices | Overview** screen, under **By platform**, select **Windows**.

4. Under **Device name**, find the device that needs to be deregistered and then select the device. If necessary, use the **Search** box.

5. In the properties screen for the device, make a note of the serial number listed under **Serial number**.

6. After making a note of the serial number of the device, select **Delete** in the toolbar at the top of the page.

7. A warning dialog box appears to confirm the deletion of the device from Intune. Select **Yes** to confirm deleting the device.

### Deregister from Autopilot

1. Make sure the device has been deregistered from Intune as described in the [Deregister from Intune](#deregister-from-intune) section.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

1. In the **Home** screen, select **Devices** in the left pane.

1. In the **Devices | Overview** screen, under **By platform**, select **Windows**.

1. In the **Windows | Windows enrollment** screen, select **Windows enrollment**

1. Under **Windows Autopilot Deployment Program**, select **Devices**.

1. In the **Windows Autopilot devices** screen that opens, under **Serial number**, find the device that needs to be deregistered by its serial number as determined in the [Deregister from Intune](#deregister-from-intune) section. If necessary, use the **Search by serial number** box.

1. Select the device by selecting the checkbox next to the device.

1. Select the extended menu icon (`â€¦`) on the far right end of the line containing the device. A menu appears with the option **Unassign user**.

   - If the **Unassign user** option is available and not greyed out, then select it. A warning dialog box appears confirming to unassign the user from the device. Select **OK** to confirm unassigning the device from the user.
   - If the **Unassign user** option isn't available and greyed out, then move on to the next step.

1. With the device still selected, select **Delete** in the toolbar at the top of the page.

1. A warning dialog box appears to confirm the deletion of the device from Autopilot. Select **Yes** to confirm deleting the device.

1. The deregistration process may take some time. The process can be accelerated by selecting the **Sync** button in the toolbar at the top of the page.

1. Every few minutes select **Refresh** in the toolbar at the top of the page until the device is no longer present.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> No additional steps are necessary to remove the device from Intune and Autopilot. Unneeded steps includes manually deleting the device from Azure AD. Manually deleting the device from Azure AD may cause unexpected problems, issues, and behavior. If needed, the device will be automatically removed from Azure AD after these steps are followed.

The above steps deregister the device from Autopilot, unenroll the device from Intune, and disjoin the device from Azure AD. It may appear that only deregistering the device from Autopilot is needed. However, there are barriers in Intune that require all the above steps to avoid problems with lost or unrecoverable devices. To prevent the possibility of orphaned devices in the Autopilot database, Intune, or Azure AD, it's best to complete all the steps.

### Deregister from Microsoft 365 admin center

The device can be deregistered in Microsoft 365 admin center if using Microsoft 365 admin center instead of Intune. To deregister an Autopilot device from the Microsoft 365 admin center:

1. Sign into to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/)
1. Navigate to **Devices** > **Autopilot**.
1. Select the device to be deregistered and then select the **Delete device** button.

### Deregister from Microsoft Partner Center (MPC)

Partners deregistering a device from Autopilot in Microsoft Partner Center (MPC) only deregisters the device from Autopilot. It doesn't perform any of the following actions:

- Unenroll the device from the MDM (Intune)
- Disjoin the device from Azure AD

> [!NOTE]
>
> If an admin registered a device via another portal other than the Microsoft Partner Center (MPC) such as Intune or Microsoft 365 admin center, the device doesn't show up in Microsoft Partner Center (MPC). For a partner to register a device in the Microsoft Partner Center (MPC), the devices first needs to be deregistered using the steps outlined in the [Deregister a device](#deregister-a-device) section.
