# Azure AD joined vs. Hybrid Azure AD joined in cloud-native endpoints

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [cloud-native-endpoints-definitions](../../includes/cloud-native-endpoints-definitions.md)]

Many critical and valuable services, including [Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) and [Azure AD single sign-on](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on), require endpoints to have a cloud identity. For organization owned Windows endpoints, a cloud identity is created when the device is Azure AD joined or Hybrid Azure AD joined.

When moving to cloud-native endpoints, you need to understand the differences between Azure AD joined and hybrid Azure AD joined devices:

- **Azure AD joined** (AADJ): Devices are joined to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). They're not joined to on-premises AD.

  For more specific information, go to [Azure AD joined devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join) (opens another Microsoft website).

- **Hybrid Azure AD joined** (HAADJ): Devices are registered in Azure AD and joined to an on-premises AD domain.

  For more specific information, go to [Hybrid Azure AD joined devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid) (opens another Microsoft website).

This feature applies to:

- Windows cloud-native endpoints

This article describes some of the differences between Azure AD joined and hybrid Azure AD joined devices. For an overview of cloud-native endpoints, and their benefits, go to [What are cloud-native endpoints](cloud-native-endpoints-overview.md).

## Azure AD joined

When an endpoint, like a Windows 10/11 device is Azure AD joined, it establishes a trust with Azure AD, and has an identity (`device-id`) in Azure AD. The endpoint is managed and controlled by the organization.

The endpoint is joined to Azure AD. It's not joined to an on-premises AD domain.

To join Windows endpoints to Azure AD, you have some options:

- **Use [Windows Autopilot](../../autopilot/index.yml)**. Windows Autopilot guides users through the Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE). When users enter their work or school account, the endpoint joins Azure AD.

  All devices registered with Windows Autopilot are automatically considered organization owned devices. Windows Autopilot is one of the most adopted approaches to get organization devices joined to Azure AD and managed by IT.  

- **Use Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE)**. When users enter their work or school account on the device, the endpoint automatically joins Azure AD.

- **Use the Settings app**. On the device, end users open the Settings app (**Accounts** > **Access work or school** > **Connect**), and use their work or school account.

- **Use a Window Provisioning Package**. For more information, go to:

  - [Provisioning packages for Windows](/windows/configuration/provisioning-packages/provisioning-packages)
  - [Bulk join a Windows device to Azure AD and Microsoft Intune using a provisioning package - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/bulk-join-a-windows-device-to-azure-ad-and-microsoft-endpoint/ba-p/2381400) blog post

### Organization IT benefits

- Using conditional access, you can allow or restrict access to organization resources that meet, or don't meet your requirements.
- Settings and work data roam through enterprise compliant clouds. No personal Microsoft accounts, like Hotmail are used, and can be blocked.
- Using Windows Hello for Business, you can reduce the risk of credential theft.

### End user benefits

- To authenticate end users with Azure AD and the Windows endpoint, users need a work or school account. No personal accounts are used.
- Get single sign-on (SSO) to Microsoft 365 and SaaS apps with an internet connection.
- Use the convenience and security of Windows Hello for Business to sign in to their Windows endpoint.

  When they sign in with Windows Hello for Business, users automatically use SSO to many of their online and on-premises apps and resources.

- OS settings roam across all Azure AD joined devices.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > End users working remotely on Azure AD joined devices don't need a VPN to sign-on when cached credentials expire on the device. On hybrid Azure AD joined devices, they do need a VPN to sign in when cached credentials expire.

- [Windows Hello for Business documentation - Windows security](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/)

## Hybrid Azure AD joined

[Hybrid Azure AD joined devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid) are joined to your on-premises AD domain and are registered with Azure AD. These devices **require** a network line-of-sight to your on-premises domain controllers (DCs) for initial sign-in and for device management.

If the devices can't connect to the DC, then users might be prevented from signing in, and may not receive policy updates.

Many organizations with existing domain joined devices want the benefits and features of Azure AD and endpoint management. If your devices can't be fully cloud-native yet, then you can register these existing devices with Azure AD. When you register existing devices in Azure AD, a [device identity](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview) is created, and your devices are hybrid Azure AD joined. They're not considered cloud-native endpoints.

If your organization is ready and wants to be cloud-native, then [Azure AD joined](#azure-ad-joined) (in this article) is the correct choice. Existing devices will need to be reset. For more specific information and guidance, go to the [High level planning guide](cloud-native-endpoints-planning-guide.md).

### Hybrid Azure AD joined resources

For information on how to register your existing domain joined devices to Azure AD, go to [Configure hybrid Azure AD join](/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-hybrid-azure-ad-join). [Configure hybrid Azure AD join](/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-hybrid-azure-ad-join) includes information for managed domains and federated domains.

## Which option is right for your organization

The right option depends on your environment, your endpoints, and your organization goals. When making this decision, consider the future and long term impact.

Consider the following scenarios:

| Scenario | AADJ or HAADJ |
| --- | --- |
| You have new endpoints or can reset existing endpoints | ✔️ Azure AD join <br/><br/> If you have new, refurbished, or refreshed Windows devices, then Azure AD joined is recommended. Windows 10/11 has modern features built in to the OS, including modern management, modern authentication, and more. AADJ should be your default option for new and refurbished endpoints. <br/><br/> It's possible there will be blockers and challenges outside of Microsoft's control that can prevent your organization from fully adopting AADJ. There may also be unknown blockers that are specific to your organization and its configuration or expectations. These blockers can be technical or happen due to other, non-technical factors.<br/><br/>If you identify a potential blocker that's preventing you from using AADJ, then determine the scope, impact, and solution. The [High level planning guide to move to cloud-native endpoints](cloud-native-endpoints-planning-guide.md) may help.<br/><br/>❌ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/><br/> You can use HAADJ for new endpoints, but it's typically not recommended. When joined using HAADJ, you might not get to use the modern features built into Windows 10/11.  |
| Endpoints can't be reset or reprovisioned |  ❌ Azure AD join <br/><br/> Existing devices joined to an on-premises AD domain must be reset to become Azure AD joined. If they can't be reset, then AADJ isn't possible. <br/>  <br/>✔️ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/> <br/>If you have existing endpoints that are joined to an on-premises AD domain, and can't be reset, then Hybrid Azure AD joined might be the easiest option for your organization. Devices get a cloud identity and can use cloud services that require a cloud identity. For end users with existing endpoints, this option typically has minimal impact. |
| You have new endpoints and have existing AD joined endpoints that can't be reset | ✔️ Azure AD join <br/><br/> AADJ should be your default option for new, refurbished, or refreshed Windows devices. <br/><br/> ✔️ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/> <br/> If you have existing endpoints that are joined to an on-premises AD domain, and can't be reset, then Hybrid Azure AD joined might be your only option. <br/> <br/> Hybrid Azure AD joined and Azure AD joined aren't mutually exclusive, and can coexist in the same environment. Having a mixed environment does increase complexity, maintenance tasks, and support costs. But, you can use HAADJ until those endpoints can be replaced or reset. Remember, Hybrid Azure AD joined shouldn't be your organization's end goal. |
| You want to be cloud-only, and remove dependency to on-premises | ✔️ Azure AD join <br/><br/> The cloud solution is to AADJ your endpoints. The endpoints and their identities are created and stored in Azure AD, and Intune manages the endpoints with settings and policies. These services work with other cloud services, including Microsoft 365, Microsoft 365 Defender, and more. <br/><br/>❌ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/><br/> HAADJ requires connectivity to on-premises domain controllers (DCs). |
| You want to manage endpoints using MDM policies | ✔️ Azure AD join <br/><br/> Microsoft Intune, which is a 100% cloud solution, can manage Windows client devices. Intune has many built-in features and settings that can manage settings, control device features, help secure your endpoints, and more. <br/><br/>The [High level planning guide to move to cloud-native endpoints: Intune features you should know](cloud-native-endpoints-planning-guide.md#intune-features-you-should-know) lists some of these features. [What is Intune](../../memdocs/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune.md) is also a good resource. <br/><br/>❌ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/><br/> On HAADJ endpoints, you must use group policies objects (GPO) to control policy settings. If you enable [co-management](../../memdocs/configmgr/comanage/overview.md) (Intune (cloud) + Configuration Manager (on-premises)), then you can use some Azure AD features, such as conditional access. <br/><br/>For some guidance, go to [Deployment guide: Setup or move to Microsoft Intune](../../memdocs/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-intune-setup.md). |
| You want to eliminate on-premises AD for authentication and sign-on  | ✔️ Azure AD join <br/><br/> User identities are created and stored in Azure AD. Users can sign in to their endpoints from anywhere and at any time. If you use [passwordless authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless), then users might not need internet access to sign in. <br/><br/> AADJ endpoints can also use modern authentication, including multifactor authentication (MFA), smart card authentication, and certificate-based authentication.<br/><br/> ❌ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/><br/> HAADJ endpoints require a line-of-sight to the on-premises AD domain controller for initial sign-in and to change passwords. If the domain is down, or there isn't any internet access, then users could be blocked from signing in to their endpoints. <br/><br/> If you use [passwordless authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-faqs), then users need internet access and line of sight to the DCs. HAADJ endpoints can use kerberos and NTLM to authenticate. |
| You need to access on-premises resources | ✔️ Azure AD join <br/><br/> AADJ endpoints can access on-premises resources, and can use single sign-on (SSO). For more specific information, go to [Cloud-native endpoints and on-premises resources](cloud-native-endpoints-on-premises.md).<br/><br/>✔️ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/><br/> HAADJ endpoints can use single sign-on (SSO) across your cloud and on-premises resources. For more specific information, go to [Configure hybrid Azure AD join](/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-hybrid-azure-ad-join). |
| You want device compliance and/or conditional access | ✔️ Azure AD join <br/><br/> With Microsoft Intune or [co-management](../../memdocs/configmgr/comanage/overview.md) (Intune (cloud) + Configuration Manager (on-premises)), you can create [compliance policies](../../memdocs/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started.md). When combined with [conditional access](../../memdocs/intune/protect/conditional-access.md), you can enforce your compliance policies on AADJ endpoints. <br/><br/>✔️ Hybrid Azure AD join<br/><br/> With Microsoft Intune or [co-management](../../memdocs/configmgr/comanage/overview.md) (Intune (cloud) + Configuration Manager (on-premises)), you can create [compliance policies](../../memdocs/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started.md). When combined with [conditional access](../../memdocs/intune/protect/conditional-access.md), you can enforce your compliance policies on HAADJ endpoints. |
