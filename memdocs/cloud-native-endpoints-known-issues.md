# Known issues and limitations with cloud native endpoints

When using or moving on-premises device management to cloud native endpoints, there are some scenarios you need to know. This article lists and describes some changed behaviors, limitations, and resolutions.

Cloud native endpoints are devices that are joined to Azure AD. In many cases, they don't require a direct connection to any on-premises resources for usability or management. For more specific information, see [Cloud native endpoint overview](cloud-native-endpoints-overview.md).

In this article, **Azure AD joined** and **cloud native endpoints** are used interchangeably.

## Don't use machine authentication

Machine authentication occurs when resources, like file shares, printers, and web sites use computer or machine accounts to authenticate, instead of using users or user groups to authenticate.

When a Windows endpoint, like a Windows 10/11 device joins Active Directory, a computer account is automatically created. A unique password is negotiated between the endpoint and AD. These computer accounts identify the device, and are independent of any user signed in to the device.

Cloud native endpoints are joined to Azure AD, and don't exist in Active Directory. So, cloud native endpoints don't support machine authentication. Securing file shares, applications, or services using machine accounts will fail on cloud native endpoints.

### Switch to user-based authentication

- Don't use machine authentication. It's not common, but it's something you need to know and be aware.
- Review your environment and identify any applications and services that use machine authentication. Then, change the access to user-based authentication or service account-based authentication.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure AD Connect doesn't create equivalent AD computer accounts in the on-premises AD domain. Using Azure AD joined device for on-premises machine authentication isn't supported in this configuration. ??What is meant by "this"??
>
> For more specific information and guidance, see [What is Azure AD Connect?](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect).

### Common services that use machine accounts

The following list includes common features and services that might use machine accounts to authenticate. It also includes recommendations if your organization is using these features with machine authentication.

- **Network storage access** fails with machine accounts. Cloud native endpoints can't access file shares secured using machine accounts. If ACL (access control list) permissions are assigned only to machine accounts, or assigned to groups that include only machine accounts, then drive mapping with file shares or network-attached storage (NAS) shares will fail.

  **Recommendation**:

  - **Server and workstation file shares**: Update permissions to use user account-based security. When you do, use [Azure AD single sign-on (SSO)](/azure/active-directory/devices/azuread-join-sso) to access resources that use Windows integrated authentication.

    Move file share content to SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business. For more specific information, see [Migrate file shares to SharePoint and OneDrive](/sharepointmigration/fileshare-to-odsp-migration-guide).

  - **Network File System (NFS) root access**: Direct users to access specific folders, not the root. If you can, move content from a NFS to SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business.

- On Azure AD joined Windows endpoints, **Win32 apps**:

  - Won't work if the apps use machine account authentication.
  - Won't work if the apps access resources that are secured with groups that include only machine accounts.

  **Recommendation**: ?? Need something here. I added the following??

  - Check the authentication and identities of your kiosk devices and applications. Update the authentication and identities to use user account-based security.

- **IIS web server** deployments that restrict site access using ACL permissions with only computer accounts, or groups of computer accounts, will fail. Authentication strategies that limit access to only computer accounts or groups of computer accounts will also fail.

  **Recommendation**: ?? Need something here??

  Additional resources:

  - [IIS Authentication `<windowsAuthentication>`](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/authentication/windowsauthentication/)
  - [IIS Security Authorization `<authorization>`](/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/authorization/)

- Standard **print management and discovery** depends on machine authentication. On Azure AD joined Windows endpoints, users can't print using standard print.

  **Recommendation**: Use Universal Print. For more specific information, see [What is Universal Print](/universal-print/fundamentals/universal-print-whatis).

- **Windows scheduled tasks** that run in the machine-context on cloud native endpoints can't access resources on remote servers and workstations. The cloud native endpoint doesn't have an account in Active Directory, and therefore can't authenticate.

  **Recommendation**: Configure your scheduled tasks to use **logged in user**, or another form of account-based authentication.

- **Login scripts** aren't available for cloud native endpoints. ??Why? I assume it's related to machine authentication. If no, create a separate H2??

  **Recommendation**: In your login scripts, look at the actions to determine if there is a modern equivalent.

  For example, migrate userâ€™s home drives to OneDrive, and migrate shared folder content to SharePoint Online. ??I assume this example is related to an action that has a modern equivalent. If yes, then we should explain more. Currently, it's confusing.??

  If actions in the script don't have a modern equivalent, then you can deploy the script using [Endpoint Manager Windows PowerShell scripts](/mem/intune/apps/intune-management-extension).

## Group policy objects might not apply

**Issue**: It's possible some of your older policies aren't available, or don't apply to cloud native endpoints.

Evaluate your existing **group policy** objects (GPO) using [Group Policy Analytics](/mem/intune/configuration/group-policy-analytics) in Endpoint Manager.

**Resolution**:

- In endpoint management, policies are deployed to users and groups. They aren't applied in LSDOU order. This is a mind shift, so make sure your users and groups are in order.
- Inventory your policies, and determine what they do. You may find categories, such as policies that focus on security, policies that focus on the OS, and so on.
- Be prepared to create new policies. The built-in features of modern endpoint management, like Microsoft Intune, may have better options to create and deploy policies.
- Don't migrate all your policies. Remember, your old policies might not make any sense with cloud native endpoints.

  Instead of doing what you've always done, focus on the what you actually want to achieve.

## Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) aren't supported

**Issue**: Currently, cloud native endpoints don't support the [Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](/defender-for-identity/cas-isp-laps) (opens another Microsoft website).

LAPS manages local administrator account passwords for domain-joined devices. Passwords are randomized and stored in Active Directory (AD), and protected by ACLs. So, only eligible users can read the password or request a password reset.

Microsoft will release an update to provide LAPS for Azure AD joined devices. When it's released, you can use it to manage local administrator account passwords on cloud native endpoints.

**Resolution**: Azure AD joined devices use Azure AD to configure users and groups that will have local administrator privileges. For more information and guidance, see [How to manage local administrators on Azure AD joined devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/assign-local-admin).

## Synchronized user accounts can't complete first sign-in

**Issue**: Synchronized user accounts are on-premises AD domain users that are synchronized to Azure AD using Azure AD Connect.

Currently, synchronized user accounts with passwords that have **User must change password at next logon** configured can't complete a first-time sign in to a cloud native endpoint.

**Resolution**: Use Password Hash Sync and Azure AD connect, which forces the **force password change at logon** attribute to sync.

For more specific information, see [Implement password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization#synchronizing-temporary-passwords-and-force-password-change-on-next-logon).
