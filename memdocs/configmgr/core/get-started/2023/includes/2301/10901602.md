## <a name="bkmk_msfb"></a>Removing MSfB new config capability & in-product warnings. 

<!--10901602-->

As part of Microsoft Store for Business deprecation, we are making these changes to the customer experience with using this feature: 

-Removing a user's ability to create new MSfB configurations in Configuration Manager. 

-Display a warning message box when user triggers a sync from Microsoft Store from Business. 

-Display a warning in the Create Application Wizard when user attempts to create a new app from Store license information.
