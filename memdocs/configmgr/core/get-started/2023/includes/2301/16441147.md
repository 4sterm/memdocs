## <a name="bkmk_softwareupdates"></a> Update to the default value of supersedence age in months for software updates. 

With Unified Update Platform (UUP) nearing general availability release, we would require the feature update and non-feature update superdense should be greater than 3, for new software update role installations we are updating this to 6, for existing customer they can review and update this to 6 when the feature is released during GA. 

Update to the default value of supersedence age in months for software updates.
