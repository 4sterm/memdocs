<!--15885998-->

Starting this technical preview 2301 release, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager is now Microsoft Configuration Manager.   

Microsoft Configuration Manager is an integrated solution for managing all your devices. Microsoft brings together Configuration Manager and Intune, without a complex migration, and with simplified licensing. Continue to leverage your existing Configuration Manager investments, while taking advantage of the power of the Microsoft cloud at your own pace.
