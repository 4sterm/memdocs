## <a name="bkmk_ASR"></a> Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) capability now marks Server SKU as compliant only after enforcement

<!--9217349-->
Prior to the Attack Surface Reduction capability in Windows Server, ASR rules were marked compliant by default. As this rule setting becomes available to Server SKU, it is enforced through Config Manager. Now the Server SKU will be marked as compliant for an ASR rule, only after enforcement of the rule.
