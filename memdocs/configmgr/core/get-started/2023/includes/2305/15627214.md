## <a name="bkmk_CMGC"></a> CMG creation using 3rd PartyApp via Console

<!--15627214-->
We have deprecated the use of 1st party app for the creation of CMG. Now, CMG will use a 3rd party server app to get bearer tokens. 
For CMG creation, users can select tenant and the app name using the Azure AD tenant name.  After selecting of tenant and app name the sign-in button appears.Existing Customers, must update their server app as current version,does not have the Redirect to- "http://localhost"

To update the server app, you can navigate to Azure Active Directory Tenants node --> select the tenant --> select the server app --> click on "update application settings".
