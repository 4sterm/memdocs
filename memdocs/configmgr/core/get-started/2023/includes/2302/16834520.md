## <a name="bkmk_winfeatures"></a>Enable Windows features introduced via Windows servicing that are off by default

<!--16834520-->

To learn more about the: “Enable Windows features introduced via Windows servicing that are off by default” item, please read this [blog] (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/commercial-control-for-continuous-innovation/ba-p/3737575) .  It describes the Commercial control for continuous innovation in Windows. The setting for this policy has now been integrated with the Configuration Manager 2302 Technical Preview. The blog gives more information about the Commercial control timeline and which version of Windows 11 will support the setting. The Windows features that the policy actually controls will be released later in 2023, so we’re releasing this feature now in the ConfigMgr Technical Preview for awareness, but you can’t test it directly in February 2023.
