## <a name="bkmk_dark"></a> Dark theme extended to delete secondary site wizard

<!--15942599-->
The Configuration Manager console now extends the dark theme for the delete secondary site wizard. This wizard will also have a new look for the normal mode. This is part of the ongoing effort to make dark theme and overall admin console experience better. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/15942599-console-dark-theme.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dark theme for the delete secondary site wizard.":::

To use the theme, select the arrow from the top left of the ribbon, then choose **Switch console theme**. Select **Switch console theme** again to return to the light theme. Using a console theme can help you easily distinguish a test environment from a production environment or one hierarchy from another.


### Known issue

Restart the console when you first switch to a different theme, as the node navigation pane might not properly render when you move to a new workspace.
