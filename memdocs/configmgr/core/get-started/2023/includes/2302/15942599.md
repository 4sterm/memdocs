## <a name="bkmk_dark"></a> Dark theme extended to delete secondary site wizard

<!--15942599-->
The Configuration Manager console now offers the dark theme for the delete secondary site wizard. This wizard will also have a new look for the normal mode. This is part of the ongoing effort to make dark theme and overall admin console experience better. 

To use the theme, select the arrow from the top left of the ribbon, then choose **Switch console theme**. Select **Switch console theme** again to return to the light theme. Using a console theme can help you easily distinguish a test environment from a production environment or one hierarchy from another.


### Known issue

When you first switch to a different theme, you may notice the node navigation pane doesn't properly render when you move to a new workspace. Restart the console to resolve this issue.
