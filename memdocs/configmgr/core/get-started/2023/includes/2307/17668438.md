## <a name="bkmk_Externalnotification"></a> External service notification Run details from Azure Logic application

<!--17668438-->
When Azure Logic Apps generate notifications or alerts related to specific events or conditions, CM can now capture and display these notifications within the console to the users. This integration enables the monitoring and management of Azure Logic App notifications directly within the Configuration Manager console, providing a centralized location for tracking critical events, taking appropriate actions and maintain a high level of operational efficiency.
