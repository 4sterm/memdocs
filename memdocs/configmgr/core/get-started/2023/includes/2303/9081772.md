## <a name="bkmk_SQlodbc"></a> Prerequisites for the site server roles now include ODBC driver for SQL Server.

<!--9081772-->

Starting with Configuration Manager version 2303 technical preview version, Configuration Manager will now require the installation of the ODBC driver for 
SQL server as a prerequisite whenever you create a new site or update an existing one. 

Configuration Manager doesn't manage the updates for the ODBC driver. Please ensure that this component is up to date.
