## <a name="bkmk_deeplink"></a> Direct links to Configuration Manager Community hub items
<!--4224406-->
You can now easily navigate to and reference items in the Configuration Manager console Community hub node with a direct link. The intention for this feature is for easier collaboration and being able to share links to Community hub items with your colleagues. Currently, you'll see these links shared by the Configuration Manager team and in the documentation.

For example, use this link to share the Configure Edge Auto Update script. If you have the technical preview branch version 2006 console installed, follow that link, and then select **Launch the Community hub**. The console opens directly to the script in the Community hub.

> [!NOTE]
> These deep links are currently only for items in the Community hub node of the console.
