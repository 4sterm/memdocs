## <a name="bkmk_availapp"></a> Improvements to available apps via CMG

<!--7033501-->

An internet-based, domain-joined device that isn't joined to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and communicates via a cloud management gateway (CMG) can now get apps deployed as available. The Active Directory domain user of the device needs a matching Azure AD identity. When the user starts Software Center, Windows prompts them to enter their Azure AD credentials. They can then see any available apps.

Configure the following prerequisites to enable this functionality:

- Windows 10 device

  - Joined to your on-premises Active Directory domain

  - Communicate via CMG

- The site has discovered the user by both [Active Directory](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#bkmk_aboutUser) and [Azure AD user discovery](../../../../servers/deploy/configure/about-discovery-methods.md#azureaddisc)
