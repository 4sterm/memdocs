## <a name="bkmk_epcmg"></a> CMG support for endpoint protection policies

<!--4773948-->

While the cloud management gateway (CMG) [has supported endpoint protection policies](../../../../clients/manage/cmg/supported-configurations.md#bkmk_note1), devices required access to on-premises domain controllers.<!-- 4350561 --> Starting in this release, clients that communicate via a CMG can immediately apply endpoint protection policies without an active connection to Active Directory.
