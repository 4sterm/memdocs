## <a name="bkmk_anchor"></a> Default site boundary group behavior to support cloud source selection
<!--10674394-->
You can now add options via PowerShell to include and prefer CMG Management Points (MP) for default site boundary group. When a site is set up, there's a Default Boundary Group (DBG) created for each site and all the clients are by default mapped to DBG until they're assigned to some custom boundary group. 

Currently on the admin console, an admin can add references to default boundary group, but the added references don't have any effect when the client requests for MP list. Starting with TP 2206, Admins can include and prefer cloud-based sources (only for MP role now) for the clients in default boundary group, using PowerShell Cmdlets.  

> [!NOTE]
> Admin wonâ€™t be able to configure this from SCCM console. Please see below for PowerShell cmdlet details. 

#### Set-CMDefaultBoundaryGroup 

Use this cmdlet to modify the properties of a default boundary group. You can set the options to include and prefer the cloud-based sources for the clients in default boundary group. 

**Syntax:**  

Set-CMDefaultBoundaryGroup [-IncludeCloudBasedSources <Boolean>] [-PreferCloudBasedSources <Boolean>] 

**Examples:**

Set-CMDefaultBoundaryGroup -IncludeCloudBasedSources $true -PreferCloudBasedSources $true 

Set-CMDefaultBoundaryGroup -IncludeCloudBasedSources $true 

Set-CMDefaultBoundaryGroup -IncludeCloudBasedSources $true -PreferCloudBasedSources $false 

**Parameters:**

-IncludeCloudBasedSources: Used to specify whether admin wants to include the cloud-based sources in the MP list for the clients in default boundary group. 

-PreferCloudBasedSources: Used to specify whether admin wants to prefer the cloud-based sources in the MP list for the clients in default boundary group. On selecting this option, cloud-based servers will be given preference by the clients. 

> [!NOTE]
> Admin can only set this option to true if the parameter IncludeCloudBasedSources is set to true or was already set to true by the admin.
