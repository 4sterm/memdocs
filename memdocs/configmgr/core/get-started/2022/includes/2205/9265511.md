## <a name="bkmk_downlevel"></a> Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding for Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016
<!--9265511-->
Configuration Manager will now utilize the [Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 unified](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints?#new-windows-server-2012-r2-and-2016-functionality-in-the-modern-unified-solution) solution for anti-virus and endpoint detection and response. Starting with this technical preview, devices that are targeted with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding policy will use the unified agent versus the previous Microsoft Monitoring Agent based solution (where applicable).

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality will only apply to clients that are onboarding. Upgrade scenarios will be supported in a future release. If you'd like to test this new functionality, you can offboard and onboard an existing device.
