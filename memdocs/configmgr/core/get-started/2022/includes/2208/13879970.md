<!--13879970 -->

If the osdinjection.xml file is directly modified it is not correctly preserved updating to a new Configuration Manager version.
Example modifications include adding support for additional binaries or for an alternate content provider (ACP). When this issue occurs, operating system deployment task sequences fail to resolve required dependencies. The smsts.log file contains the following error.

```Failed to load TSCore.dll Code (0x8007007E).```
