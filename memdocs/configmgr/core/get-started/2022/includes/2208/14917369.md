## <a name="bkmk_improvements-to-the-dark-theme"></a> Dark theme is now extended to additional dashboards

<!--14917369, 14959592, 14969236-->

In this release we've extended the dark theme to additional dashboards which previously did not display the dark theme correctly. For example, the O365 Updates Dashboard, PCM Dashboard, and Health Attestation dashboard will now display according to the dark theme, when it is enabled.

Enable this pre-release feature to experience the dark theme. For more information, see [Dark theme for the console.](../../../../../core/servers/manage/admin-console.md)
