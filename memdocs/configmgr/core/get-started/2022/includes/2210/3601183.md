## <a name="bkmk_featured-apps-software-center"></a> Featured Apps in Software Center

<!--3601183-->
We are now adding the **Featured** tab in Software Center where we will be displaying the featured apps. 
Using this, IT admin can mark apps as "featured" and encourage end users to use the app. 
Currently, this feature is available only for "User Available" apps. 
Also, admins can make the **Featured** tab of Software Center as default tab from Client Settings. 

If an app is marked as **Featured** and it is deployed to a User Collection as an Available app, it will show under the **Featured** pivot in Software Center.

For more information, see [Software Center in Configuration Manager](../../../../../../understand/software-center.md)
