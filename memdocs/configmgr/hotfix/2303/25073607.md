# Windows 11 client update for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2303

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch, version 2303)*
## Summary of KB25073607

An update is available that fixes the following issue with the Configuration Manager current branch, version 2303, and Windows 11 version 22H2 clients.
 
Windows 11 version 22H2 clients configured with a deferral policy for Windows Updates and managed by Configuration Manager current branch, version 2303, may not show updates as applicable.

This happens because the value for the *UseUpdateClassPolicySource* registry key under *HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU* is not correctly set. This update correctly sets the value for Configuration Manager clients. 

## Update information for Microsoft  Configuration Manager
The following hotfix to resolve this problem is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

[Download this hotfix now](link).

After you download the hotfix, see the following documentation for installation instructions:

[Use the Update Registration Tool to import hotfixes to Configuration Manager](../../core/servers/manage/use-the-update-registration-tool-to-import-hotfixes.md)

#### Prerequisites
To apply this hotfix, you must be using Configuration Manager, version 2303 in addition to the following update:

[KB21010486](./21010486.md) Update rollup for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2303

#### Restart information
This update does not require a computer restart or initiate a site reset.

### Other installation information
After you install this update on a primary site, pre-existing secondary sites must be manually updated. To update a secondary site in the Configuration Manager console, select **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites** >  **Recover Secondary Site**, and then select the secondary site. The primary site then reinstalls that secondary site by using the updated files. Configurations and settings for the secondary site are not affected by this reinstallation. The new, upgraded, and reinstalled secondary sites under that primary site automatically receive this update.

Run the following SQL Server command on the site database to check whether the update version of a secondary site matches that of its parent primary site:
   ```code
   select dbo.fnGetSecondarySiteCMUpdateStatus ('SiteCode_of_secondary_site')
   ```
If the value 1 is returned, the site is up to date, with all the hotfixes applied on its parent primary site.

If the value 0 is returned, the site has not installed all the fixes that are applied to the primary site, and you should use the **Recover Secondary Site** option to update the secondary site.

## Hotfix replacement information
This hotfix doesn't replace any previously released hotfix.

## File information
File information is available in the downloadable [KB25073607_FileList.txt](https://aka.ms/KB25073607_FileList) text file.
