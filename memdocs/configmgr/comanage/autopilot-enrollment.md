# How to enroll with Autopilot

<!-- Intune 5637106 -->

When you use [Windows Autopilot](../../autopilot/windows-autopilot.md) to provision a device, it first enrolls to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft Intune. If the intended end-state of the device is co-management, previously this experience was difficult because of component timing and policy delays.

Now you can configure device enrollment in Intune to enable co-management, which happens during the Autopilot process. This behavior directs the workload authority in an orchestrated manner between Configuration Manager and Intune.

You no longer need to create and assign an Intune app to install the Configuration Manager client. The Intune enrollment policy automatically installs the Configuration Manager client as a first-party app. The device gets the client content from the Configuration Manager CMGcloud management gateway, so you don't need to provide and manage the client content in Intune. You do still specify the command-line parameters. This list can optionally include the [PROVISIONTS property](../core/clients/deploy/about-client-installation-properties.md#provisionts) to specify a task sequence.

If the device is targeted with an [Autopilot enrollment status page (ESP) policy](../../intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md), the device waits for Configuration Manager. The Configuration Manager client installs, registers with the site, and applies the production co-management policy. Then the Autopilot ESP continues.

## Requirements

The following components are required to support Autopilot into co-management:

- Windows devices running one of the following versions:

  - Windows 11

  - At least Windows 10, version 20H2, with the latest cumulative update

- Register the device for Autopilot. For more information, see [Windows Autopilot registration overview](../../autopilot/registration-overview.md).

  - Azure AD-joined only

  - User-driven scenario only

- Configuration Manager version 2010 or later

  - Set up a cloud management gateway (CMG). For more information, see [CMG overview](../core/clients/manage/cmg/overview.md).

  - Enable co-management. For more information, see [How to enable co-management](how-to-enable.md).

## Limitations

Autopilot into co-management currently doesn't support the following functionality:

- Hybrid Azure AD-joined devices

- Autopilot pre-provisioning, also known as _white glove_ provisioning

- Workloads switched to **Pilot Intune** with pilot collections. This functionality is dependent upon collection evaluation, which doesn't happen until after the client is installed and registered. Since the client won't get the correct policy until later in the Autopilot process, it can cause indeterminate behaviors.

- Clients that authenticate with PKI certificates. You can't provision the certificate on the device before the Configuration Manager client installs and needs to authenticate to the CMG. Azure AD is recommended for client authentication. For more information, see [Plan for CMG client authentication: Azure AD](../core/clients/manage/cmg/plan-client-authentication.md#azure-ad).

## Configure

Use the following process to configure the co-management policy in Intune:

1. Go to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).

1. Select the **Devices** menu, select **Enroll devices**, and then select **Windows enrollment**.

1. Select **Co-management settings**, and then select **Create**.

1. Select **Yes** to automatically install the Configuration Manager client.

1. Specify the client installation command-line parameters. You can copy these parameters from the co-management properties page.

1. After you configure these settings, go to the **Assignments** page and select a target group. For more information, see [Assign user and device profiles in Microsoft Intune](../../intune/configuration/device-profile-assign.md).

### Advanced settings

By default, the device waits for and uses the workload assignments from the Configuration Manager co-management policy. In the **Advanced** area of this policy, you can select **Yes** to override the co-management policy and use Intune for all workloads. Use this option for devices that are primarily cloud-managed with Intune policies, but you need the Configuration Manager client for certain apps. Even when Intune is the authority for the **Client apps** workload, a co-managed device can still get apps from Configuration Manager. For more information, see [Workloads: Client apps](workloads.md#client-apps) and [Use the Company Portal app on co-managed devices](company-portal.md).
